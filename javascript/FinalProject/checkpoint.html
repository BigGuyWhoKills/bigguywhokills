	<h2>Adam Howell's CS 2550 Checkpoint File</h2>
	Main components of the 'game' logic:<br>
	<ol>
		<li>
			When categoryItem objects are created, the net value is determined at creation-time. - Implemented<br>
			While this is implemented, it is not a user-observable activity.
		</li>
		<li>
			When categoryItem objects are pushed onto the array, a totals categoryItem object is created. - Implemented<br>
			While this is implemented, it is not a user-observable activity.
		</li>
		<li>
			Cell style is only changed if a value has been modified. - Implemented<br>
			Click on a cell, enter a new value in the prompt box, and click OK.<br>
		</li>
		<li>
			When a cell is clicked, display the row and column number of that cell. - Implemented<br>
			Click on any cell.  The values are displayed lower on the page.<br>
			Note that the table header cells are not clickable, but are considered to be a row in the table, so row 0 is not observable.  However, column 0 is observable.
		</li>
		<li>
			Recalculate the cell values after changes. - NOT implemented<br>
			This will require reading in the entire table, parsing each cell to get its new value, and rebuilding the table.
		</li>
		<li>
			Remove rows. - Partially implemented<br>
			Currently, this is hard-coded to the initial row names.<br>
			I intend to update this to eventually read the first column from each row, and populate the list with that.
		</li>
		<li>
			Add a new row. - Partially implemented<br>
			The form is set up for this, but the code is not written yet.
		</li>
		<li>
			User log in. - Implemented<br>
		</li>
		<li>
			Local storage. - Implemented<br>
		</li>
	</ol>
