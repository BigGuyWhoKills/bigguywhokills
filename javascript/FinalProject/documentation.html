	Here are the highlights of my implementation:
	<ul>
		<li>My program makes a XMLHttpRequest request to load "gamedata.json" from the same directory, and parses the responseText into a JSON object.</li>
		<li>That JSON object is passed to a function that walks through the object, moving category data into one array, and expense data into another array.</li>
		<li>After that, the tables are drawn.</li>
		<li>A form allows for adding a new category. &nbsp;When that happens, it is added to the category array and the category table is redrawn. &nbsp;Additionally, the add new expense form is updated to show the new category.</li>
		<li>The category table allows the user to edit the budgeted amount for each category.</li>
		<li>The expense table allows all columns to be edited, aside from the delete-button column.</li>
		<li>When dates in the expense table are changed, the expenses will re-sort to keep all expenses ordered from oldest at the top to newest at the bottom.</li>
		<li>The "Save Expenses" button will call a function to save all current game data to local storage.</li>
		<li>The "Restore Expenses" button will call a function to load previously saved expense data from local storage.</li>
		<li>This can be tested by changing table data, and saving. &nbsp;Them refresh the page to load from the JSON file, and use "Restore Expenses" to see the old data you previously saved.</li>
		<li>A button is provided to delete local storage, and another to show what is currently in local storage.</li>
		<li>A "Recalculate" button is provided to force an update of the tables, but this no longer needed as my code refreshes the tables after every change.</li>
	</ul>
	Here is the rubric for this project, followed by how I have met each requirement:
	<ol>
		<li>Game grid that uses CSS and is generated by JavaScript.<br>
			CSS is used to format my table by default. &nbsp;That formatting is overridden by cellOnClick() in storage.js when a cell's contents are altered. &nbsp;My buildCategoryTable() and buildExpenseTable() functions in storage.js are the core components that generate the tables in JavaScript.
		</li>
		<li>User input in the form of text, select options, and/or buttons.<br>
			All three of these input options are used on my expenses.html page. &nbsp;A text input box is provided to add a new category. &nbsp;A numerical input box in that same fieldset allows the user to designate how much should be budgeted for that category. &nbsp;A button is used below those two inputs to submit them to my control mechanism. &nbsp;Finally, a select drop-down list is used on the add-expense fieldset to allow the user to select a category. &nbsp;That drop-down select is updated every time a new category is added.
		</li>
		<li>User input in the form of mouse clicks.<br>
			Cell in the table (on expenses.html) are clickable, due to onclick handlers that are assigned after the table is built. &nbsp;Some cells are intentionally not clickable, such as the "Totals" row in the category table. &nbsp;If a clickable cell is clicked, a prompt window pops up and allows the user to edit the contents. &nbsp;If the cell value is not changed, or if the prompt window is canceled, and no changes are made to the table. &nbsp;If a value is changed, the cell background will be changed from black to gray, and the new value will show in the cell. &nbsp;Immediately after the user clicks "OK", the cell value us updated and the tables are recalculated. &nbsp;When those tables are recalculated, the background color is reverted back to black. &nbsp;So the gray background color may not be noticed if the prompt window covers the cell being edited. &nbsp;Editing the date of an expense will re-sort it within expenseArray[] and on the HTML table.
		</li>
		<li>Dynamic modification of HTML using innerHTML or DOM functions.<br>
			This requirement is satisfied on both the game description page (index.html) and the actual expense tracker (expenses.html). &nbsp;An easy example to test is the "results" div on expenses.html. &nbsp;It will show the row number and column number of the cell that is clicked.
		</li>
		<li>Use of XMLHttpRequest to load JSON or XML game data that is displayed on the grid page.<br>
			I load example expense data from 'gamedata.json' in the root directory of this folder or archive. &nbsp;This can be observed by altering data in that file, and noting the change in the resulting table on the expenses.html page (reload that page to see changes to the file).
		</li>
		<li>Incorporates HTML 5 audio tags, video tags, canvas, or local storage.<br>
			I am using local storage to satisfy this requirement. &nbsp;This can be observed on the expense tracker (expenses.html) table caption reflecting the userName used to log in to the site (from assignment 5). &nbsp;Additionally, I have a button that will display rudimentary local storage information in the console log, and another button that will delete local storage created by my project. &nbsp;I have also implemented the ability to store category and expense information to local storage. &nbsp;I am currently working on loading that data back into the live display. &nbsp;This can be tested by altering a few cells, Clicking "Save Expenses", reloading the page to bring in values from gamedata.json, and finally clicking "Restore Expenses" to see the table revert to the changes you previously made.</li>
		<li>Game logic code.<br>
			My game logic sums all expense amounts and stores that value in the "Spent amount" column of the category table. &nbsp;Another function sorts the expenses by their date (in <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards/iso8601.htm">ISO 8601 format</a>).
		</li>
	</ol>
