- Film is generally shot and projected at 24 frames per second (fps), so when 
film frames are converted to NTSC video, the rate must be modified to play at 
29.97 fps. During the telecine process, twelve (12) fields are added to each 24 
frames of film (12 fields = 6 frames) so the same images that made up 24 frames 
of film then comprise 30 frames of video.In this process, which would more 
accurately be called 2-3 pull down, the first frame of film is represented by 2 
fields of video; the second frame of film is represented by 3 fields of video 
(1.5 frames); the third frame of film is again represented by two fields and the 
fourth frame of film is represented by 3 fields, and so on. In the end, what was 
running at 23.976 fps is running at 29.97 fps. For a more detailed explanation,

ambience is the background-sound quality of a listening room, surround 
processor, and/or recording. The ambience of a recording is what gives it space

control on the monitor manually adjusted downwards. "Anamorphic" in
video is a misnomer. Video has no aspect ratio until it is displayed on the
screen. The TV set or monitor determines the aspect ratio using settings
specified by the viewer or sometimes automatically by taking some format data
(not the picture data) from the video signal. So far the label "anamorphic"

- Without echo. An anechoic situation exists when acoustic signals produced by a 
source are not reflected back to it or anywhere else. Room reverberation does 
not exist under anechoic conditions. Most recordings are not recorded 
anechoically, because the sonic signature of the environment is a part of what 
the engineer will want to record. Note that because the ground is reflective, a 
true anechoic condition would only exist fairly high up off the ground and 
outdoors. A skydiver experiences anechoic conditions. (See <a href="#Ambience">

The ratio of image width to image height. The present day TV standards (<a href="#Ntsc">NTSC</a>,

Academy ratio and most movies prior to 1950 were shot with this ratio. Wide
screen movies were invented to attract moviegoers who would otherwise stay at
home watching TV. The U.S. high definition TV standard calls for a 16:9 (1.77:1)
aspect ratio. The majority of motion pictures are 1.85 or 2.35 times the height,
or 1.85:1 and 2.35:1. When widescreen movies (films with aspect ratios wider
than 1.33:1) are displayed on 1.33:1 televisions, the image must be letterboxed,

<a name="Automatic Color Correction">Automatic Color Correction</a></b> - A
circuit found in many consumer viewing devices that attempts to compensate for
the "Never Twice the Same Color" problems that have been found in
broadcast quality. Depending on the implementation, this type of circuit can go
far beyond the Auto Tint function. It changes color saturation as well as type
of color. In most cases, where an ACC circuit is present, it can not be turned
off. Adjusting the color and tint controls, using the SMPTE Color Bar pattern
and the blue filter will result in a gross misadjustment of color level on the

calibrated with the SMPTE Color Bar pattern.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>
<a name="Automatic Frequency Control">Automatic Frequency Control</a></b> -
A circuit that automatically keeps an oscillator on frequency. When present on a
TV set, the AFC control usually applies to the TV channel tuning section. It
keeps the tuner locked to the channel selected. It could also be labeled AFT for
Automatic Fine Tuning. Modern sets with digital tuning often have this
capability built in, without an option to turn it on or off. Under normal
circumstances this function is desirable and should be left on. An ability to
turn it off might be helpful when the TV set is using an antenna to receive
distance signals in the face of strong local signals. The function of AFC can be
applied to other circuits in a viewing device. In those cases we&#8217;ve not seen
an ability to turn the AFC on or off. If it exists it is always on.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><a name="Automatic Gain Control">Automatic Gain Control</a></b> -
Automatic gain can be applied ahead of almost any circuit that requires specific
levels to operate. As an example, the color decoder needs to see a particular
level of color subcarrier at its input in order to display the correct color at
the output. There is a reference burst of color subcarrier at the beginning of
each horizontal line of known original amplitude. The AGC circuit looks at the
incoming signal level and applies what ever gain correction necessary to make
that burst correct in amplitude. In the process of doing that, it also corrects
the amplitude of the color information in the active picture area. There are
certain limits in the accuracy of this circuit. If the incoming burst amplitude
is really low, the AGC circuit might not function at all or amplify the signal
more than it should. This is of particular concern when attenuation in the cable
delivering the video signal to the set reduces the color information much more
than it should. The AGC circuit will actually cause the color to look high, if
it has over amplified the weak signal, or the set may only display a black and
white picture if it doesn&#8217;t amplify the signal at all. Several S-Video cable
manufacturers have been know to play this game, claiming their cable delivers
richer color quality.</p>

<a name="Bipole Speaker">Bipole
Speaker</a></strong> - Bipole speakers generally (there are always exceptions) use identical
complements of speaker drivers located in the classic front of the box position as well as
on the rear panel. The drivers are wired "in phase." This means that since the
drivers are fed the same signal, they are all doing essentially the same thing. Looking at
the behavior of the woofers for example, when they are fed the positive portion of the
signal (which moves them forward), both woofers are moving forward at the same time. The
same goes with the midranges and tweeters. But here&#8217;s the rub. Since the drivers are
back to back with each other, they&#8217;re relative movements actually have them moving in
opposite directions. Even though the phase is the same, one woofer is pushing to the

  <strong>Bloom</strong>  (Audio) - A quality of expansive richness and warmth, like the
live body sound of a cello.</p>

<p> 
  <strong>Bloom</strong>  (Video) - When phosphors are driven harder than they
should be, they disperse much of the extra energy to adjacent areas. It's sort
of like sharing the load. The problem with sharing the load is that areas of the
picture that shouldn't be lit up are lit up. That reduces the sets ability to
show fine detail, not to mention slight light output changes near peak white.
Blooming causes a softening of edges, a lack of gray scale detail near white,
and often a change in color quality. Keeping a set out of blooming is therefore
important to a good picture. Doing that requires turning the Contrast control
way down. Since most sets come from the factory with the Contrast control turned
all the way up, it will often be difficult for you to judge the real capability
of a TV set when viewed in the store. An important consideration in purchasing a
set is, will it produce a usable amount of light once the Contrast is turned
down below the point of blooming.</p>

Refers to compact disks that can be recorded one at a time, or the equipment
used to make the recordings. The so-called CD-R disk can only be recorded once;
if the recorded content is no longer wanted, additional material can be recorded
only on the space remaining subject to the recording method chosen, or if there
is no remaining space the disk is discarded. The disks themselves are
constructed differently from ordinary non-recordable CD's. Ordinary CD's are
stamped like grooved records, and then the silver or gold reflective layer
applied. Recordable CD's have the foil layer (gold colored) already applied, and
the recording consists of "burning" the pits into an intervening layer
of organic dye one at a time. Current technology allows recordings to be made in
1/4 the time that an audio CD plays (1/4 of 74 minutes or 19 minutes per side)
although owners of consumer grade CD recorders have tended to find that
recording faster than "2x" often yields a defective disk. 
</p><p><b>CD-RW (Compact Disk, Rewritable) </b>- Refers to
compact disks that can be recorded one a time and where an unwanted recording
can be recorded over. The disks themselves are constructed differently from
other types of CD's; they contain an organic dye that represents the pits that
in turn represent the recorded content. "The jury is out" as far as
the longevity of these disks goes; to this writer the organic content suggests
possible aging problems that color film today still has. Not all CD players can
play CD-RW disks since the reflective surface has a different color from the
usual silver or gold. 
</p><p><b><a name="Ced">CED</a> (Capacitance Effect Disk) </b>-
Also referred to as "RCA Selectavision" video disks.. This is a 12
inch video disk and player system marketed by RCA, and now obsolete. It did not
have consumer recording capability. No laser was used; the disks were grooved
like (pre-CD) phonograph records, and the video signal was recorded as rising
and falling ripples ("hill and dale" in older phonograph terminology).
The needle, or stylus, does not follow the ripples exactly, it is not small
enough or given enough pressure to. Under current technology it is impossible to
make a stylus small and light enough at reasonable cost to do so. Instead, the
rapidly varying tiny air space between the stylus and the groove bottom is
sensed (using capacitance) to derive the video signal. According to
specifications, the disks give about an hour's playing time on a side with 240
lines of horizontal resolution. One revolution of the disk corresponds to four
video frames. The disk is never seen or touched in normal use. The viewer
inserts the rigid jacket (caddy)&nbsp;into the player and then withdraws it
leaving the disk behind. To unload the disk, the jacket is inserted again.</p>

<p><b><a name="Class-A Amplifier">Class-A Amplifier</a></b> 
- A design in which the output devices of the amplifier conduct current all of

<p><strong>Clean</strong> - Free from audible distortion.<br>

  <br>

  <strong>Click</strong> - A small, sharp impulse that sounds like the word
"click."<br>

  <br>

  <strong>Clinical</strong> - Sound that is pristinely clean but wholly
uninvolving.</p>

<p><b><a name="Clipping">Clipping</a></b> - In audio, the 
result of an analog signal's being overdriven to the extent that its peak levels 
cannot be accommodated, and therefore are "clipped" off from the audible signal. 
Typical in smaller amplifiers, it is the most audible of common electronic 
distortions.</p>

<p><b>Clock-In </b>- Probably
the universal method of converting an analog video signal to digital. Since an
incoming video signal arrives one pixel at a time, it is <a href="#Sampling">
sampled 
  </a>at fixed time intervals (in nanoseconds). Essentially the signal is chopped
up into little pieces, much as a chef may chop carrots or celery or bananas into
slices. Clocking in has the shortcoming of sometimes taking the last half of one
pixel and the first half of the next pixel (pixel straddling) as a new pixel
when the incoming analog video was digital at some earlier time; the former
pixel footprint remains. This results in loss of horizontal resolution.
Interpolation may occur naturally during clock-in and the result varies
depending on whether the digital value (sample) is derived from the entire slice
(averaged) or only a small portion of the slice. (Additional interpolation may
or may not be done later.)<br>

  <br>

  <strong>Closed-In</strong> - Lacking in openness, delicacy, air, and fine
detail. A closed-in sound is usually caused by HF rolloff above 10kHz. (Compare <a href="#Open">

<p><b>Closed-Loop Drive</b> - A tape-recorder drive system 
in which the tape is pulled by dual capstans on either side of the heads. The 
result is a very uniform tension and less <a href="#Wow-and-Flutter">
wow, flutter,</a> and scrape-induced 
distortion</p>

<p><b><a name="Clv">CLV</a>
(Constant Linear Velocity) </b>- Refers to analog
laser disks where the rotational speed varies (1800 to 600 RPM) so that the
amount of track circumference spanned by the laser beam is the same for each
video frame. Since the circumference of each revolution of the spiral track near
the outer edge (later in the program) is greater, the disk is slowed down as the
program progresses. A CLV disk holds about an hour's worth of program material
on a side. Only the more expensive players can do slow motion or still frames
when playing CLV disks, and usually only an even interlaced field or an odd
interlaced field is seen at any given time. Incidentally the concept of CLV is
used on all good tape recorders. You might observe that the cassette spool (or
reel on an older machine) revolution speed varies. The take up spool mimics the
behavior of the CLV laser disk, the beginning of the program's tape is at the
center and the spool rotates fastes then.<br>

  <strong>Coarse</strong> - A large-grained texturing of reproduced sound; very
gritty. The continuum of reproduced sound seems to be comprised of large
particles. (See <a href="#Texture">texture</a>.)</p>

<p><b><a name="Coax (Coaxial Cable)">Coax (Coaxial Cable)</a> </b>- A round cable where one
of the conductors is a thin wire running down the middle and the other conductor
(usually grounded) is a cylindrical shell or braid &nbsp;that surrounds the
first conductor. Some "two conductor plus ground" cables have two thin
wires running down the middle. Other cables have one wire in the middle
surrounded by two concentric shells. Coax cable is often used to connect video
components. The insulating material that keeps the center conductor centered
determines the quality of the cable and/or the kinds of video signals that the
cable can carry without degradation. Some people reserve the words "coax
cable" to refer to the round 75 Ohm cable that carries TV signals from an
antenna or cable TV system.</p>

<p><b>Coaxial -</b> 1) A speaker with one driver in front
of (and on the same axis of) another driver. 2) An audio or video cable with a
single center pin that acts as the hot lead and the outer shield that acts as a
ground.</p>

<p><strong>Cocktail-Party Effect</strong>
- The auditory system's controllable ability to separate-out, on the basis of
direction alone, one sound source from many coming from different directions. It
allows you to follow one voice among the others at a noisy cocktail party.</p>

<p><strong>Codec -</strong> (EnCOder/DECoder) A process or 
device by which or in which a signal is encoded for transmission or storage, 
then decoded for playback. As a process it is the algorithm that handles the 
compression and decompression of video or audio files. As a device it could be a 
box or computer card that accomplishes the encode/decode process.</p>

most important and often overlooked adjustment to be performed on an rptv

tubes are driven in equal proportions the resulting light should be "white."
There are many different colors of "white," from the very
warm orange glow from a 25 watt soft white light bulb to a very cool looking bluish glow
from a high intensity metal halide lamp. Color temperature is measured in degrees Kelvin,
from the 25-watt bulb at about 2000 degrees Kelvin to the metal halide bulb at about 9000
degrees Kelvin. The higher the "color temperature" the bluer the color of
"white" looks. (degrees Kelvin correlates to the color of light emitted from an

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><a name="Comb Filter">Comb Filter</a></b>
 - An electronic filter whose frequency response when graphed suggests the teeth
of a comb; the filter alternately accepts and rejects small bands of frequencies
"as we progress up the scale." One way of visualizing what a comb
filter does is to draw evenly spaced parallel lines, alternately red and black,
on paper, and then look through a comb held so as to hide all of the black
lines. Such an array of lines could (and does) stand for the luminance and color
content of a video signal and comb filters are used in the more expensive TV
sets to perform the necessary task of separating the two. Notch and bandpass
filters, common on lower priced TV sets as an alternative, produce acceptable
pictures but with more discoloration and limited horizontal resolution.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b><a name="Comb Filtering (Audio)">
Comb Filtering (Audio)</a></b> - The result of two audio signals interacting in 
such a way that their combined outputs cause the frequency response to become 
more irregular and choppy appearing-like the teeth of a comb. This can happen 
when the outputs of two speaker systems (or even speaker drivers with 
overlapping outputs within the same system) reach the listener's ears at 
slightly different times. The effect is rarely detrimental unless the 
alternating peaks and dips are widely spaced. Wall reflections combining with 
the main signals also cause comb-filtering effects, although the result here is 
usually an enhanced sense of spaciousness. Indeed, at higher frequencies, 
comb-filtering effects are usually not unpleasant if the speaker systems are 
wide-dispersion models and listening is done in the reverberant field. During 
recording, the comb-filtering effects of widely spaced microphones can be 
measurably similar to what is reproduced by speakers, but the result may be 
subjectively more disturbing. Microphone comb filtering is similar to what is 
sometimes intentionally applied electrically to a monophonic signal to create a 
pseudo-stereo effect. (See <a href="#Diffraction">Diffraction</a>.)</p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><a name="Comb Filtering">Comb Filtering</a></strong>
  <b>(Video) </b>- A hollow coloration that, once recognized, is unmistakable. Caused by a
regularly spaced series of frequency-response peaks and dips, most often due to
interference between two identical signals spaced in time. If that time
difference is continually changed, the comb-filter peaks and dips move
accordingly, giving rise to the familiar "phasing,"
"flanging," or "jet plane" effect used in modern rock music.</p>

  </a>- The correct aiming of the three electron beams in a direct viewed picture
tube or three separate pictures from&nbsp;tubes in a projection TV (for red,

objects on the screen will have colored halos around them, white lines will seem
to have a red, green, or blue line next to them, and resolution will be poorer.
The most common reason for misconvergence is the coils attached to the neck of
the picture tube not in the proper position which usually takes a time consuming
trial and error process to correct. Often perfect convergence cannot be achieved
over the entire screen so a compromise where the errors are minimized but not
completely eliminated must be accepted. It may be noted that a convergence error
of one fifth of one percent means that one of the electron beams is off by a
scan line causing a halving of the resolution at that spot on the screen. Also
"convergence" refers to the bringing together and integrating of two
or more systems or technologies so that components can be shared. An example is
the development and manufacturing of video monitors suitable for television,
movies, entertainment, and also computers and data display.</p>

<p><b><a name="Decibel (dB)">Decibel (dB)</a> -</b> 
One-tenth of a Bel. Named in part after Alexander Graham Bell (hence the capital 
B), the decibel is used in both audio and video applications (although more 
often the latter) to&nbsp; compare power differences in voltage, current, watts, 
sound pressure levels (SPL), etc. The number of Bels is the common logarithm of 
the ratio of two powers. If two powers differ by 1 Bel, the greater one will be 
10 times the other. A 100-watt amplifier is 1 Bel, or 10 dB, higher in output 
than a 10-watt unit. Decibels are ratios, not fixed quantities. The logarithmic 
nature of the decibel scale corresponds to the logarithmic nature of human 
hearing. One dB SPL is commonly accepted as the smallest difference that people 
can hear, depending on the bandwidth of the manipulated signal. When measuring 
audio signal-to-noise ratios, the difference between the quietest and loudest 
sounds is stated in dB. With some kinds of equipment, such as microphones, 
analog tape recorders, or LP playback systems, the measurement is "weighted" as 
to audibility, because the ear is more sensitive to some frequencies than to 
others. Two common corrections for hearing characteristics are the A-weighted 
and the somewhat more rigorous C-weighted scales, indicated as dBA or dBC, 
respectively. (See <a href="#Signal-to-Noise%20Ratio%20%28S/N%29">

<a name="Dipole Speakers">Dipole
Speakers</a></strong> (and how they are different from Bipole Speakers) - Dipoles radiate
sound from the front and back. In contrast to bipoles, the sound is propagated out of
phase. The majority of di-polar speakers are not of the cone and dome variety and are
actually what is called "planer" speakers. There are several types of drivers
that can be used, none of which use boxes. Ribbon speakers, planer magnetic, and
electrostatics are the more common types in use with plasma drivers bringing up the rear
(a VERY distant rear!). These drivers are usually quite large, quite flat and very
shallow, usually only an inch or two deep. Their excursions are very limited compared with
those of a cone woofer so in order to move the large amounts of air, they are usually
quite large. These drivers, as stated, have no boxes, usually just a frame to hold them
up, so they radiate sound from both the front and the back. Unlike bi-poles, there is only
one driver which can only move in one direction at a time. So, when the front of the
speaker is experiencing a positive excursion (a push), the rear of the speaker must be
experiencing a negative excursion (a pull). When you stand off to the side of the dipole,
you see that the driver moves to your right or your left, relative to the relaxed
position. To produce sound waves air must be moved, creating pressure. But as you look at
this speaker from the side, you see a positive pressure on one side as the speaker pushes
out, but on the other side of the speaker, you see a negative pressure as it pulls
instead. So, from your vantage point, you get a positive with a given amplitude on one
side, but on the other side you have a negative of the same amplitude, so, with the
positive and the negative canceling each other out, from where you are, you get nothing
and you hear nothing. Of course, in reality, this is not happening in a vacuum. You are
surrounded by walls which will reflect the sound radiated to the front and to the rear.
This is why di-polar speakers are so great for surround. You are not aware of a speaker
behind you, only of an enveloping surround field. Also, the closer you get to these
speakers, the deeper into the null you get. This means that if you don't sit in the
"sweet spot," you still won't have the deteriorated experience that you get when
you have to sit closer to one mono-pole speaker than the other, i.e., you only hear that
one speaker. The deeper into the null you get, the more prominent the sound of the other
speaker! By the way, while the most common form of di-poles are the ones mentioned above,
there are boxed speakers which are dipoles too. All it takes is two sets of drivers on
opposite sides of the speaker box (like bipoles) which are wired out of phase. For home
theater applications, these are frequently small boxes which can be hung on a wall. There
are a few music oriented manufacturers selling these dynamic (cones and domes) versions of
di-poles for music also.</font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Frame </b>- All of the lines, both
odd and even, that make up one complete "painting" of the video
screen. Also any one exposed picture on a strip of movie film.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>Frame Retention</b> - A
buffer, or memory, to hold one or more fields or frames while new arriving video
information is added to it. Incoming video is a stream of information. Without
memory, the conversion circuits would have to take each line's worth of
information as it arrives and use it, or lose it forever. All progressive scan
converters and with any degree of sophistication have frame retention using
memory (similar to computer memory) to hold on a rolling basis at least one
field (half picture) of information. Then the "real" intervening line
from the previous field (say line 2) will always be on hand if the logic decided
not to blend the lines above and below (say lines 1 and 3) to synthesize that
line. Some scan converters hold more than two fields in memory. This allows
their logic to better detect motion and also allows an intervening line to be
taken from either the preceding or the following field if the subject just
started moving or just stopped moving, respectively.</p>

  <b><a name="Gamma">Gamma </a></b>- The relationship between the brightness of a spot on the picture tube
where the electron beam hit and the level of the video signal. It can be graphed
as a curved line. If twice as many electrons are fired at the screen, that spot
does not look twice as bright to the human eye, Therefore for video the gamma
graph is not straight, or linear. In practicer it also varies with the make and
model of the TV set or monitor, the nature and quality of the electronics
inside, &nbsp;and also the settings of the brightness and contrast controls.
Gamma also applies to film where the intensity of light hitting the film results
in the appropriate intensity of the color in the finished print or slide.
Adjusting gamma is difficult especially considering that most people cannot tell
what is correct unless they have a side by side comparison with the live
subject, a supposedly correct photograph of the subject, or a TV that is
adjusted correctly. Also personal preferences, comparable to preferences in
adjusting stereo bass and treble controls, affects the settings. Typical test
patterns for adjusting the gamma consist of series of stripes graduated from
black to white, some of them using gray scales, others using halftoning or
dithering of pure black and pure white dots. The user is told to adjust controls
on the monitor until some stripes are distinguishable and others blend into each
other. The instructions for using each gamma chart vary. (See <a href="#Prime">

<p><b><a name="Horizontal Resolution">Horizontal 
Resolution</a></b> - Visually resolvable vertical lines per picture height. It 
is measured by counting the number of vertical black and white lines that can be 
distinguished an area that is as wide as the picture is high. Horizontal 
resolution applies both to television displays and to signal formats such as 
that produced by a DVD player. Since DVD has 720 horizontal pixels (on both NTSC 
and PAL discs), the horizontal resolution can be calculated by dividing 720 by 
1.33 (for a 4:3 aspect ratio) to get 540 lines. On a 1.78 (16:9) display, you 
get 405 lines. In practice, most DVD players provide about 500 lines instead of 
540 because of filtering and low-quality digital-to-analog converters. VHS has 
about 230 (172 widescreen) lines, broadcast TV has about 330 (248 widescreen), 
and laserdisc has about 425 (318 widescreen). Scan lines, on the other hand, 
measure resolution along the y axis. DVD produces 480 scan lines of active 
picture for NTSC and 576 for PAL. The NTSC standard has 525 total scan lines, 
but only 480 to 483 or so are visible. (The extra lines are black and are 
encoded with other information). Since all video formats (VHS, LD, broadcast, 
etc.) have the same number of scan lines, it is the horizontal resolution that 
makes the big difference in picture quality.</p>

<p><b>Horizontal Retrace Interval </b>- The time during
which the electron beam is turned almost off (as if to draw black) and &nbsp;moved
from right to left to get ready to draw the next scan line on the picture tube.
In <a href="#Ntsc">NTSC</a> broadcast video, 10.9 microseconds are set aside for this purpose; the
entire line, retrace interval and all, takes 63.5 microseconds.. The time it
takes to draw an entire line is adequate to allow the electron beam to draw at
most 530 dots alternating black and white; the horizontal retrace interval takes
away about 90 of these dots. Of the remaining 440 (give or take a few), 330 fit
in the largest circle that in turn fits in the 4:3 screen, which leads to the
330 line horizontal resolution that is often mentioned when it comes to
broadcast TV. The exact number of dots used for the picture material depends on
the program source and the make and model of equipment.</p>

  <b><a name="Input Impedance">Input Impedance</a></b> - The 
"load" actually seen by a source connected to an input. In audio, the input
  <a href="#Impedance">impedance</a> should be considerably larger than the 
connected component's output <a href="#Impedance">impedance</a> to avoid signal 
losses and frequency-response irregularities. In video, the input and output

Also called RCA plug and phono plug. A plug designed especially for the quick
connection and disconnection of coaxial cables used with audio and other low
frequency devices. (See <a href="connectorglossary.htm">Connector Glossary</a>.)</p>
<p><b>Interlace -</b> This process divides and presents
each video frame as two fields. Imagine a video frame being divided by the odd
and even horizontal lines that make up the picture. The first field presents the
odd lines, the second field represents the even lines. The fields are aligned
and timed so that, with a still image, the human eye blurs the two fields
together and sees them as one. Motion in the image makes the fields noticeable.
Interlace scanning allows only half the lines to be transmitted and presented at
any given moment. A 1080i signal transmits and displays only 540 lines per 60th
of a second. <a href="#Ntsc">NTSC</a> transmits and displays only 240 lines per 60th of a second.
Interlaced images have motion artifacts when two fields don't match to create
the right frame&#8212;often the case with film-based material.

<p><b>Inter-Aural Cross-Talk</b> - An effect created when

sound-stage realism. (See<i> </i><a href="#Cross-Talk">Cross-talk</a>.)</p>
<p><b>Inter-Aural Cross-Talk Cancellation</b> - By 
emitting out-of-phase cancellation signals to null inter-aural cross-talk, this 
process can improve focus and sound-stage imaging. To work properly, it requires 
the listener to sit exactly in the sweet spot, out in front of and exactly 
between the speakers. The effect can be influenced by early room reflections, 
and some listeners think the process adds substantial sound-stage phasiness. It 
is available on some recordings in the form of the Q-Sound, Spatializer, or 
Roland RSS systems; variant designs that work with conventional recordings are 
also available in home processors made by Spatializer, Carver, and Lexicon, as 
well as in Polk Audio's SDA speaker systems. (See<i> </i>

<p><b><a name="Iq">I-Q</a> </b>- Refers to one method of
encoding of the color content of a video signal such that all colors could be
depicted using a two dimensional diagram, more specifically a color wheel. There
are two color signals one (I) of which represents oranges and blues and the
other (Q) represents greens and purples. (Both together are used to represent
other colors.) This choice of colors permits giving the oranges and blues, which
the human eye is more sensitive to, more frequency bandwidth and thus greater
color resolution in <a href="#Ntsc">NTSC</a> video. The remaining colors had to be limited to about
48 lines of resolution (0.6 MHz sideband width) to keep there from being too
much color information contaminating the medium detailed luminance information
in the composite video signal. Many TV sets today and all consumer 
  <a href="#VCR">VCR</a>'s limit
color resolution to a theoretical maximum of 40 lines for all colors. When it is
not necessary to construct a composite video signal, the color signals U and V
representing blue and red respectively, are usually used instead of I and Q. We
believe that all of the descriptions on this page can be understood quite well
by persons without tremendously high intelligence quotients.</p>

  <b>Jitter</b> - The unwanted variations of a binary signal's leading and 
trailing edges. It occurs as the signal is processed or transmitted from one 
point to another. Most jitter is caused by noise picked up from a phase-locked 
loop (PLL) in the signal path. Jitter also is a time displacement, either 
periodic or random, of a signal's switching edges. You can think of jitter as 
the lengthening or shortening of one signal element, usually one bit time, in an 
NRZ binary signal. Jitter also can be considered as a form of FM, and it 
produces an FM-like spectrum.</p>

- The ratio of the number of psychologically perceived analog lines of

<p><b><a name="Keystone Correction">Keystone Correction</a></b> 
- Adjusts for the fact that if a projector is directed towards the screen at an 
angle, the projected image will be distorted; the edge furthest away from the 
projector will be wider than the edge closest to the projector. In other words, 
the image will appear in the shape of a trapezoid. Vertical keystone correction 
capability is measured as the number of degrees off center the projector can be 
positioned while still fully correct for the keystone effect. When positioning a 
projector off center, it might not be possible to perfectly focus the whole 
projected image, since one edge is further away from the lens than the other 
edge. Optical keystone correction adjusts the image proportions by physically 
modifying the light-path through the lens system. The correction happens after 
the light has been reflected off (passed through) the image panel(s) in the 
projector, hence the full panel remain in use - there is no loss of resolution. 
Digital keystone correction adjusts the image proportions by shrinking the image 
at the edge furthest away from the screen before it is generated by the 
projectors image panel(s). Hence, the image will lose resolution towards this 
edge. Digital keystone correction may also introduce artifacts, such as jagged 
edges. Horizontal keystone works the same way as vertical keystone, but the 
projector is moved to the left or to the right of the image's horizontal center.</p>

<p><b><a name="LCD">LCD</a> -</b> Liquid
Crystal Displays are a transmissive device. Light isn't created by the liquid
crystals, but transmitted through it. The display consists of two polarizing
transparent panels and a liquid crystal surface sandwiched in between. Voltage
is applied to certain areas, causing the crystal to turn dark. A light source
behind the panel is transmitted through transparent crystals and is partially
blocked by dark crystals. Because the light is only partially blocked in dark
areas, LCDs aren't able to create deep blacks; therefore, can't generally create
considerable contrast. Resolution is limited by the panel array. LCDs are
capable of substantial light output.</p>
<p><b><a name="LCOS (Liquid Crystal On Silicon)">LCOS 
(Liquid Crystal On Silicon)</a></b> - A reflective technology that uses liquid 
crystals instead of individual mirrors. In LCOS, liquid crystals are applied to 
a reflective mirror substrate. As the liquid crystals open and close, the light 
is either reflected from the mirror below, or blocked. This modulates the light 
and creates the image. LCOS-based projectors typically use three LCOS chips, one 
each to modulate light in the red, green, and blue channels. In this it is 
similar to an LCD projector which uses three LCD panels. Both LCOS and LCD 
projectors deliver the red, green, and blue components of the light to the 
screen simultaneously. There is no spinning color wheel used in these projectors

<p><b>Lens Shift</b> - Allows a projector to be positioned 
above or below the projected image's vertical center, yet horizontally, not 
pointing towards the center of the screen. Lens shift (screen offset) is 
expressed as a percentage of the projected image height (25% in the example 
above). It is measured as an offset from the projected image's vertical center. 
Positive values correspond to the projector being positioned above the image 
center. Negative values correspond to the projector being positioned below the 
image center. When a projector is centered in front of the projected image (i.e. 
on the vertical center), the lens shift (screen offset) is 0%. When a projector 
is below the projected image (so that the bottom of the image is at the level of 
the lens), the lens shift is -50% (not -100% as some have reported). Horizontal 
lens shift works the same way as vertical lens shift, but the projector is moved 
to the left or to the right of the image's horizontal center. Note that lens 
shift isn't commonly supported by home theater projectors. The ability to 
project from an off-center position is instead often implemented using digital

<p style="color: rgb(204, 204, 204);"><b><a name="Overscan">Overscan</a> </b>- The adjustment
of a TV set so that all four edges of the video frame are slightly outside the
screen. This was done by TV manufacturers decades ago when TV pictures shrank if
the power line voltage dropped, the latter occurring often when everyone was
using a lot of electricity. With overscan, there would still be enough picture
to completely cover the screen when the picture shrank, and viewers stopped
complaining that TV sets were defective.. However program material at the edges
of the screen is lost. Today's TV sets don't suffer from picture shrinkage as
much but overscan still occurs and too much of it is now regarded as a quality
control deficiency. Still, TV producers keep important material away from the
edges of the video frame, and many video cameras have marked in their
viewfinders a "safe area." Sometimes the electronics in the TV set are
deficient (rounded off horizontal and/or vertical sweep sawtooth waveforms) that
the extreme edges of the picture are "squished" and overscan is
deliberately used to hide this distorted material outside the screen borders.</p>

<b>Sensitivity -</b>
<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">A standardized

at 1 meter with 2.83 volts applied, which will amount to 1 watt at 8 ohms (2 
watts at 4 ohms). while sensitivity has little bearing on overall sound quality, 
it will be a factor in determining the required amplifier power. In other words, 
it is a </span>measure (in

the glass screen of the picture tube. It physically constrains the electron beam
intended for the red phosphor dots (or stripes) from hitting anything but the
red phosphor dots, and so on. Normally the exact shadow mask that will be
installed in a picture tube is used to assist in printing the phosphor dots on
the screen of that picture tube, as the optical process of printing the phosphor
dots closely mimics the path of the electron beam. Mating a shadow mask with a
screen panel early in the manufacturing process prevents slight variations from
one mask to another from affecting the quality of the finished picture tubes.</p>

of the video circuits are altered so that higher video frequencies (fine
horizontal details) are accentuated. Sharpness is not a focus control; it does
not change the electron beam spot size. Increasing sharpness can introduce or
accentuate ringing, ghost edges close to and to the right of dark to light or
light to dark transitions. As a rule, sharpness should be first set to its
"off" or "neutral" position and then optionally carefully
adjusted to suit the viewer's personal desires.</p>

become a wide screen film is shot in the 4:3 aspect ratio so that when committed
to video, the entire width of the picture can be included and also the entire TV

are not suitable for inclusion in a video edition because the special effects
added later fell short of these areas or because extraneous things such as
microphone booms were caught in those areas. This writer believes that when a

during the production of Return of the Jedi. Inspired by George Lucas' interest in
upgrading film presentation standards in the industry, Lucasfilm's Corporate Technical
Director, Tomlinson Holman, began to identify problems related to theatre sound. Holman
noted theatre audiences were not hearing what was recorded in the film studio - many of
the subtle sounds were missing. His innovative approach was to consolidate existing
performance standards into a new system which included theatre acoustics as well as sound
equipment. THX (named after Lucas' first feature film, THX 1138) is a sound system
designed specifically to reproduce film sound exactly as it was recorded by the filmmaker.
The THX Sound System is the only program of its kind to consider all aspects of a
theatre's audio &amp; visual performance, including architecture, acoustics and equipment.
"THX is really a performance criteria; it's not a specific set of components,"
says Holman. The system was created to complement advances made by Dolby Laboratories in
decoding sounds in the sound track which concentrates on the "A-Chain." The THX
Sound System concentrates on the "B-Chain" of a theatre's sound system. The
"B-Chain" is comprised of customized acoustical design work for each auditorium,
a special screen speaker installation method, a proprietary electronic crossover network,
and rigorous audio equipment specifications and performance standards. Upon completion of
a THX Sound System installation, the theatre is tested by a THX engineer to make sure it
meets both THX environmental technical criteria and recommended industry standards for
high quality visual and sound presentation. T<span lang="en-us">h</span>eat<span lang="en-us">e</span>rs are recertified to ensure that
optimum quality is maintained. </font></p>

<p style="color: rgb(204, 204, 204);" class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">A certified THX
theatre carries several important advantages for the movie-goer. The audience enjoys a
more naturally balanced sound that uniformly reaches every seat in the auditorium,
improved dialog intelligibility and decreased bass distortion. Better stereo localization
makes the sound appear to travel across the screen with action. A frequency range that is
wider by a full octave in both bass and treble allows patrons to hear higher highs and
lower lows. The combined result is the reproduction of the same clear, dynamic sound
originally created by the filmmaker. The exhibitor's unique challenge is to create an
environment that keeps the magic of the big screen alive. With installations in more than
1400 certified THX theatres and dubbing facilities worldwide, the THX Sound System has
become the premium standard for quality film presentations.</font></p>

<span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: Times New Roman;">The speed 
variation of a mechanical playback device such as an LP record player or analog 
tape recorder. Short-term speed variations are sometimes called flutter. Digital 
recording and playback devices do not produce wow, because their outputs are 
controlled (and slightly delayed) by an internal clock mechanism. Wow created by 
warped LP records is called <i>warp wow.</i> </span></p>

A proprietary stereophonic video system designed by 
Thomson electronics for budget-grade TV sets. This is not a true stereo system 
like the dbx version used in MTS; instead it uses small amounts of negative 
cross-feed to simulate stereo. (See<i> </i><a href="#DBX%20Noise%20Reduction">

<b>YPrPb</b> - Color representation requires three 
independent variables. CRTs&nbsp; prefer red, 
green, and blue.&nbsp;NTSC encodes color as luminance (brightness), hue (color), and 
saturation (absence of white in colors). Storage media such as DVDs prefer Y, 
Pr, and Pb, where Y is luminance, Pr is Y-red, and Pb is Y-blue, because Pr and 
Pb can be at lower resolution and not degrade the image noticeably, thus saving 
storage space.</p><p style="color: rgb(204, 204, 204);"><b>YPrPbHV</b>&nbsp;-

<p style="color: rgb(204, 204, 204);"><b><a name="z"></a>Z Meter -</b> A device used for measuring impedances. Instruments of this kind take four principal forms: 1) a direct-reading meter resembling an ohmmeter; 2) an adjustable circuit manipulated somewhat like a bridge that compares an unknown impedance with a standard resistance; 3) an impedance bridge for evaluating reactive and resistive components of an unknown impedance; 4) a section of transmission line used with a signal source and voltmeter for measuring impedance in terms of a standard resistor and/or standing waves.</p>

<p style="color: rgb(204, 204, 204);"><b>Zoom Range (of a Projector)</b> - <a href="#Throw%20Ratio">Maximum throw ratio / Minimum throw ratio</a>. A larger zoom range allows for more flexibility in positioning a projector, but it is also important to make sure that the maximum throw ratio and minimum throw ratio includes the sought distance and screen size. Some lenses are wider-angle (i.e.,&nbsp; cover short throw distances) while others are more in the tele-range (i.e., cover large throw distances). Note that in both cases, the zoom range might be the same.<br>
