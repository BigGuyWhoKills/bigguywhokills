<b><i>Roll The Bones</i></b>
<p><a NAME="Dreamline"></a><i>Dreamline</i>
<br><i>Lyrics by Neil Peart</i>
<p>He's got a road map of Jupiter
<br>A radar fix on the stars
<br>All along the highway
<br>She's got a liquid-crystal compass
<br>A picture book of the rivers
<br>Under the Sahara
<p>They travel in the time of the prophets
<br>On a desert highway straight to the heart of the sun
<br>Like lovers and heroes, and the restless part of everyone
<br>We're only at home when we're on the run
<br>On the run
<p>He's got a star map of Hollywood
<br>A list of cheap motels
<br>All along the freeway
<br>She's got a sister out in Vegas
<br>The promise of a decent job
<br>Far away from her hometown
<p>They travel on the road to redemption
<br>A highway out of yesterday -- that tomorrow will bring
<br>Like lovers and heroes, birds in the last days of spring
<br>We're only at home when we're on the wing
<br>On the wing
<p>When we are young
<br>Wandering the face of the Earth
<br>Wondering what our dreams might be worth
<br>Learning that we're only immortal --
<br>For a limited time
<p>Time is a gypsy caravan
<br>Steals away in the night
<br>To leave you stranded in Dreamland
<br>Distance is a long-range filter
<br>Memory a flickering light
<br>Left behind in the heartland
<p>We travel in the dark of the new moon
<br>A starry highway traced on the map of the sky
<br>Like lovers and heroes, lonely as the eagle's cry
<br>We're only at home when we're on the fly
<br>On the fly
<p>We travel on the road to adventure
<br>On a desert highway straight to the heart of the sun
<br>Like lovers and heroes, and the restless part of everyone
<br>We're only at home when we're on the run
<br>On the run...
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="Bravado"></a><i>Bravado</i>
<br><i>Lyrics by Neil Peart</i>
<p>If we burn our wings
<br>Flying too close to the sun
<br>If the moment of glory
<br>Is over before it's begun
<br>If the dream is won --
<br>Though everything is lost
<br>We will pay the price,
<br>But we will not count the cost
<p>When the dust has cleared
<br>And victory denied
<br>A summit too lofty
<br>River a little too wide
<br>If we keep our pride --
<br>Though paradise is lost
<br>We will pay the price,
<br>But we will not count the cost
<p>And if the music stops
<br>There's only the sound of the rain
<br>All the hope and glory
<br>All the sacrifice in vain
<br>[And] if love remains
<br>Though everything is lost
<br>We will pay the price,
<br>But we will not count the cost
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="Roll The Bones"></a><i>Roll The Bones</i>
<br><i>Lyrics by Neil Peart</i>
<p>Well, you can stake that claim --
<br>Good work is the key to good fortune
<br>Winners take that praise
<br>Losers seldom take that blame
<br>If they don't take that game
<br>And sometimes the winner takes nothing
<br>We draw our own designs
<br>But fortune has to make that frame
<p>We go out in the world and take our chances
<br>Fate is just the weight of circumstances
<br>That's the way that lady luck dances
<br>Roll the bones
<p>Why are we here?
<br>Because we're here
<br>Roll the bones
<br>Why does it happen?
<br>Because it happens
<br>Roll the bones
<p>Faith is cold as ice --
<br>Why are little ones born only to suffer
<br>For the want of immunity
<br>Or a bowl of rice?
<br>Well, who would hold a price
<br>On the heads of the innocent children
<br>If there's some immortal power
<br>To control the dice?
<p>We come into the world and take our chances
<br>Fate is just the weight of circumstances
<br>That's the way that lady luck dances
<br>Roll the bones
<p>Jack -- relax.
<br>Get busy with the facts.
<br>No zodiacs or almanacs,
<br>No maniacs in polyester slacks.
<br>Just the facts.
<br>Gonna kick some gluteus max.
<br>It's a parallax -- you dig?
<br>You move around
<br>The small gets big. It's a rig
<br>It's action -- reaction --
<br>Random interaction.
<br>So who's afraid
<br>Of a little abstraction?
<br>Can't get no satisfaction
<br>From the facts?
<br>Better run, homeboy --
<br>A fact's a fact
<br>From Nome to Rome, boy.
<p>What's the deal? Spin the wheel.
<br>If the dice are hot -- take a shot.
<br>Play your cards. Show us what you got --
<br>What you're holding.
<br>If the cards are cold,
<br>Don't go folding.
<br>Lady Luck is golden;
<br>She favors the bold. That's cold
<br>Stop throwing stones --
<br>The night has a thousand saxophones.
<br>So get out there and rock,
<br>And roll the bones.
<br>Get busy!

<p><a NAME="Face Up"></a><i>Face Up</i>
<br><i>Lyrics by Neil Peart</i>
<p>Your turn my head
<br>I spin my wheels
<br>Running on empty --
<br>You know how that feels
<p>I'm on a roll now --
<br>Or is it a slide?
<br>Can't be too careful
<br>With that dangerous pride
<br>If I could only reach that dial inside
<br>And turn it up
<p>Face up -- Or you can only back down
<br>Face up -- Hit the target, or you better hit the ground
<br>Face up -- There's still time to turn the game around
<br>Face up -- Turn it up --
<br>Or turn that wild card down
<br>Turn it up
<p>Don't complain
<br>Don't explain
<br>I don't think my new resolve
<br>Can stand the strain
<p>I'm in a groove now --
<br>Or is it a rut?
<br>I need some feedback
<br>But all the lines are cut
<br>I get so angry, but I keep my mouth shut
<br>And turn it up
<p>You get all squeezed up inside
<br>Like the days were carved in stone
<br>You get all wired up inside
<br>And it's bad to be alone
<p>You can go out, you can take a ride
<br>And when you get out on your own
<br>You get all smoothed out inside
<br>And it's good to be alone
<br>Turn it up

<p><a NAME="The Big Wheel"></a><i>The Big Wheel</i>
<br><i>Lyrics by Neil Peart</i>
<p>Well, I was only a kid -- didn't know enough to be afraid
<br>Playing the game, but not the way the big boys played
<br>Nothing to lose -- maybe I had something to trade
<br>The way the big wheel spins
<p>Well, I was only a kid, on a holy crusade
<br>I placed no trust in a faith that was ready-made
<br>Take no chances on paradise delayed
<br>So I do a slow fade
<p>Playing for time
<br>Don't want to wait for heaven
<br>Looking for love
<br>For an angel to forgive my sins
<br>Playing with fire
<br>Chasing something new to believe in
<br>Looking for love
<br>The way the big wheel spins
<p>Well, I was only a kid, cruising around in a trance
<br>Prisoner of fate, victim of circumstance
<br>I was lined up for glory, but the tickets sold out in advance
<br>The way the big wheel spins
<p>Well, I was only a kid, gone without a backward glance
<br>Going for broke, going for another chance
<br>Hoping for heaven -- hoping for a fine romance
<br>If I do the right dance
<p>Wheel goes round, landing on a twist of faith
<br>Taking your chances you'll have the right answers
<br>When the final judgment begins
<p>Wheel goes round, landing on a leap of fate
<br>Life redirected in ways unexpected
<br>Sometimes the odd number wins
<br>The way the big wheel spins
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="Heresy"></a><i>Heresy</i>
<br><i>Lyrics by Neil Peart</i>
<p>All around that dull gray world
<br>From Moscow to Berlin
<br>People storm the barricades
<br>Walls go tumbling in
<p>The counter-revolution
<br>People smiling through their tears
<br>Who can give them back their lives
<br>And all those wasted years?
<br>All those precious wasted years --
<br>Who will pay?
<p>All around that dull gray world
<br>Of ideology
<br>People storm the marketplace
<br>And buy up fantasy
<p>The counter-revolution
<br>At the counter of a store
<br>People buy the things they want
<br>And borrow for a little more
<br>All those wasted years
<br>All those precious wasted years
<br>Who will pay?
<p>Do we have to be forgiving at last?
<br>What else can we do?
<br>Do we have to say goodbye to the past?
<br>Yes I guess we do
<p>All around this great big world
<br>All the crap we had to take
<br>Bombs and basement fallout shelters
<br>All our lives at stake
<p>The bloody revolution
<br>All the warheads in its wake
<br>All the fear and suffering
<br>All a big mistake
<br>All those wasted years
<br>All those precious wasted years
<br>Who will pay?
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="Ghost of a Chance"></a><i>Ghost Of A Chance</i>
<br><i>Lyrics by Neil Peart</i>
<p>Like a million little doorways
<br>All the choices we made
<br>All the stages we passed through
<br>All the roles we played
<p>For so many different directions
<br>Our separate paths might have turned
<br>With every door that we opened
<br>Every bridge that we burned
<p>Somehow we find each other
<br>Through all that masquerade
<br>Somehow we found each other
<br>Somehow we have stayed
<br>In a state of grace
<p>I don't believe in destiny
<br>Or the guiding hand of fate
<br>I don't believe in forever
<br>Or love as a mystical state
<p>I don't believe in the stars or the planets
<br>Or angels watching from above
<br>But I believe there's a ghost of a chance
<br>We can find someone to love
<br>And make it last
<p>Like a million little crossroads
<br>Through the backstreets of youth
<br>Each time we turn a new corner
<br>A tiny moment of truth
<p>For so many different connections
<br>Our separate paths might have made
<br>With every door that we opened
<br>Every game we played
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="Neurotica"></a><i>Neurotica</i>
<br><i>Lyrics by Neil Peart</i>
<p>You just don't get it
<br>What it is ... well, you're not really sure
<br>You move like you're walking on thin ice
<br>Talking like you're still insecure
<p>Time is a spiral -- Space is a curve
<br>I know you get dizzy, but try not to lose your nerve
<br>Life is a diamond you turn into dust
<br>Waiting for rescue, and I know you just
<br>Don't get it
<br>You just don't get it
<p>Neurotica -- Exotica
<br>It's just Erotica -- Hypnotica
<br>It's just Psychotica -- Chaotica
<br>It's just Exotica -- Neurotica
<p>You just don't get it
<br>Baby, don't you ask yourself why?
<br>If you don't like the answer -- forget it
<br>You know I hate to see you cry
<p>Fortune is random -- Fate shoots from the hip
<br>I know you get crazy, but try not to lose your grip
<br>Life is a diamond you turn into dust
<br>Looking for trust, and I know that you just
<br>Don't get it
<br>You just don't get it
<p>Snap!
<br>Hide in your shell, let the world go to hell
<br>It's like Russian roulette to you
<br>Snap!
<br>Sweat running cold, you can't face growing old
<br>It's a personal threat to you
<br>Snap!
<br>The world is a cage for your impotent rage
<br>But don't let it get to you
<br>Snap!

<br><i>Lyrics by Neil Peart</i>
<p>Just another hunter, like a wolf in the sun
<br>Just another junkie on a scoring run
<br>Just another victim of the things he has done
<br>Just another day -- in the life of a loaded gun
<p>The odds get even -- You name the game
<br>The odds get even -- The stakes are the same
<br>You bet your life
<p>Just another winner, pours his life down the drain
<br>Just another island in a hurricane
<br>Just another loser, like a cat in the rain
<br>Just another day -- in the path of a speeding train
<p>The odds get even -- You name the game
<br>The odds get even -- The stakes are the same
<br>You bet your life

<p>Just another gypsy with a plastic guitar
<br>Just another dancer with her eyes on the stars
<br>Just another dreamer who was going too far
<br>Just another drunk -- at the wheel of a stolen car
<p>The odds get even -- You name the game
<br>The odds get even -- The stakes are the same
<br>You bet your life
