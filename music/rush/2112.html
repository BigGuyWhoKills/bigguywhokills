<b><i>2112</i></b>
<p><a NAME="2112"></a><i>2112</i>
<br><i>Lyrics by Neil Peart</i>
<br><i>With acknowledgment to the genius of Ayn Rand</i>
<p><i>I. Overture</i>
<p>And the meek shall inherit the earth.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i>II. Temples of Syrinx</i>
<p>... "The massive grey walls of the Temples rise from the heart of every
<br>Federation city. I have always been awed by them, to think that every
single
<br>facet of every life is regulated and directed from within! Our books,
our
<br>music, our work and play are all looked after by the benevolent wisdom
of the
<br>priests..."
<p>We've taken care of everything
<br>The words you hear the songs you sing
<br>The pictures that give pleasure to you eyes.
<p>It's one for all and all for one
<br>We work together common sons
<br>Never need to wonder how or why.
<p>We are the Priests, of the Temples of Syrinx
<br>Our great computers fill the hallowed halls.
<br>We are the Priests, of the Temples of Syrinx
<br>All the gifts of life are held within our walls.
<p>Look around this world we made
<br>Equality our stock in trade
<br>Come and join the Brotherhood of Man
<br>Oh what a nice contented world
<br>Let the banners be unfurled
<br>Hold the Red Star proudly high in hand.
<p>We are the Priests, of the Temples of Syrinx
<br>Our great computers fill the hallowed halls.
<br>We are the Priests, of the Temples of Syrinx
<br>All the gifts of life are held within our walls.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i>III. Discovery</i>
<p>... "Behind my beloved waterfall, in the little room that was hidden
beneath
<br>the cave, I found it. I brushed away the dust of the years, and picked
it up,
<br>holding it reverently in my hands. I had no idea what it might be,
but it was
<br>beautiful" ...
<p>... "I learned to lay my fingers across the wires, and to turn the keys
to make
<br>them sound differently. As I struck the wires with my other hand, I
produced
<br>my first harmonious sounds, and soon my own music! How different it
could be
<br>from the music of the Temples! I can't wait to tell the priests about
it! ..."
<p>What can this strange device be?
<br>When I touch it, it gives forth a sound
<br>It's got wires that vibrate and give music
<br>What can this thing be that I found?
<p>See how it sings like a sad heart
<br>And joyously screams out its pain
<br>Sounds that build high like a mountain
<br>Or notes that fall gently like rain.
<p>I can't wait to share this new wonder
<br>The people will all see its light
<br>Let them all make their own music
<br>The Priests praise my name on this night.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i>IV. Presentation</i>
<p>... "In the sudden silence as I finished playing, I looked up to a circle
of
<br>grim, expressionless faces. Father Brown rose to his feet, and his
somnolent
<br>voice echoed throughout the silent Temple Hall." ...
<br>... "Instead of the grateful joy that I expected, they were words of
quiet
<br>rejection! Instead of praise, sullen dismissal. I watched in shock
and horror
<br>as Father Brown ground my precious instrument to splinters beneath
his feet..."
<p>I know it's most unusual
<br>To come before you so
<br>But I've found an ancient miracle
<br>I thought that you should know
<p>Listen to my music
<br>And hear what it can do
<br>There's something here as strong as life
<br>I know that it will reach you.
<p>Yes, we know it's nothing new
<br>It's just a waste of time
<br>We have no need for ancient ways
<br>The world is doing fine
<p>Another toy will help destroy
<br>The elder race of man
<br>Forget about your silly whim
<br>It doesn't fit the plan.
<p>I can't believe you're saying
<br>These things just can't be true
<br>Our world could use this beauty
<br>Just think what we might do.
<p>Listen to my music
<br>And hear what it can do
<br>There's something here as strong as life
<br>I know that it will reach you.
<p>Don't annoy us further
<br>We have our work to do.
<br>Just think about the average
<br>What use have they for you?
<p>Another toy will help destroy
<br>The elder race of man
<br>Forget about your silly whim
<br>It doesn't fit the plan.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i>V. Oracle: The Dream</i>
<p>... "I guess it was a dream, but even now it all seems so vivid to me.
Clearly
<br>yet I see the beckoning hand of the oracle as he stood at the summit
of the
<br>staircase" ...
<br>... "I see still the incredible beauty of the sculptured cities and
the pure
<br>spirit of man revealed in the lives and works of this world. I was
overwhelmed
<br>by both wonder and understanding as I saw a completely different way
to life, a
<br>way that had been crushed by the Federation long ago. I saw now how
<br>meaningless life had become with the loss of all these things ..."
<p>I wandered home though the silent streets
<br>And fell into a fitful sleep
<br>Escape to realms beyond the night
<br>Dream can't you show me the light?
<p>I stand atop a spiral stair
<br>An oracle confronts me there
<br>He leads me on light years away
<br>Through astral nights, galactic days
<p>I see the works of gifted hands
<br>That grace this strange and wondrous land
<br>I see the hand of man arise
<br>With hungry mind and open eyes
<p>They left the planet long ago
<br>The elder race still learn and grow
<br>Their power grows with purpose strong
<br>To claim the home where they belong
<br>Oh, to tear the Temples down...
<br>Oh, to change..
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i>VI. Soliloquy</i>
<p>... "I have not left this cave for days now, it has become my last refuge
in my
<br>total despair. I have only the music of the waterfall to comfort me
now. I
<br>can no longer live under the control of the Federation, but there is
no other
<br>place to go. My last hope is that with my death I may pass into the
world of
<br>my dream, and know peace at last."
<p>The sleep is still in my eyes
<br>The dream is still in my head
<br>I heave a sigh and sadly smile
<br>And lie a while in bed
<br>I wish that it might come to pass
<br>Not fade like all my dreams
<p>Just think of what my life might be
<br>In a world like I have seen
<br>I don't think I can carry on
<br>Carry on this cold and empty life
<br>Oh...noo.
<p>My spirits are low in the depths of despair
<br>My lifeblood spills over..
<br>&nbsp;
<p><i>VII. The Grand Finale</i>
<p>Attention all Planets of the Solar Federation
<br>Attention all Planets of the Solar Federation
<br>Attention all Planets of the Solar Federation
<br>We have assumed control.
<br>We have assumed control.
<br>We have assumed control.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="A Passage to Bangkok"></a><i>A Passage To Bangkok</i>
<br><i>Lyrics by Neil Peart</i>
<p>Our first stop is in Bogota
<br>To check Columbian fields
<br>The natives smile and pass along
<br>A sample of their yield
<br>Sweet Jamaican pipe dreams
<br>Golden Acapulco nights
<br>Then Morocco, and the East,
<br>Fly by morning light
<p>We're on the train to Bangkok
<br>Aboard the Thailand Express
<br>We'll hit the stops along the way
<br>We only stop for the best
<p>Wreathed in smoke in Lebanon
<br>We burn the midnight oil
<br>The fragrance of Afghanistan
<br>Rewards a long day's toil
<br>Pulling into Kathmandu
<br>Smoke rings fill the air
<br>Perfumed by a Nepal night
<br>The Express gets you there
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="The Twighlight Zone"></a><i>The Twilight Zone</i>
<br><i>Lyrics by Neil Peart</i>
<p>A pleasant faced man steps up to greet you
<br>He smiles and says he's pleased to meet you
<br>Beneath his hat the strangeness lies
<br>Take it off, he's got three eyes
<br>Truth is false and logic lost
<br>Now the fourth dimension is crossed
<p>You have entered the Twilight Zone
<br>Beyond this world strange things are known
<br>Use the key, unlock the door
<br>See what your fate might have in store
<br>Come explore your dreams' creation
<br>Enter this world of imagination
<p>Wake up lost in an empty town
<br>Wondering why no one else is around
<br>Look up to see a giant boy
<br>You've just become his brand new toy
<br>No escape, no place to hide
<br>Here where Time and Space collide
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="Lessons"></a><i>Lessons</i>
<br><i>Lyrics by Alex Lifeson</i>
<p>Sweet memories Flashing very quickly by
<br>Reminding me Giving me a reason why
<br>I know that My goal is more than a thought
<br>I'll be there When I teach what I've been taught
<p>You know we've told you before
<br>But you didn't hear us then
<br>So you still question why
<br>You didn't listen again
<p>Sweet memories I never thought it would be like this
<br>Reminding me Just how close I came to missing
<br>I know that This is the way for me to go
<br>You'll be there When you know what I know
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="Tears"></a><i>Tears</i>
<br><i>Lyrics by Geddy Lee</i>
<p>All of the seasons
<br>And all of the days
<br>All of the reasons
<br>Why I've felt this way
<br>So long
<br>So long
<p>Then lost in that feeling
<br>I looked in your eyes
<br>I noticed emotion
<br>And that you had cried
<br>For me
<br>I can see
<p>What would touch me deeper
<br>Tears that fall from eyes
<br>That only cry?
<br>Would it touch you deeper
<br>Than tears that fall from eyes
<br>That know why?
<p>A lifetime of questions
<br>Tears on your cheek
<br>I tasted the answers
<br>And my body was weak
<br>For you
<br>The truth
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="Something for Nothing"></a><i>Something For Nothing</i>
<br><i>Lyrics by Neil Peart</i>
<p>Waiting for the winds of change
<br>To sweep the clouds away
<br>Waiting for the rainbow's end
<br>To cast its gold your way
<br>Countless ways
<br>You pass the days
<p>Waiting for someone to call
<br>And turn your world around
<br>Looking for an answer to
<br>The question you have found
<br>Looking for
<br>An open door
<p>You don't get something for nothing
<br>You don't get freedom for free
<br>You won't get wise
<br>With the sleep still in your eyes
<br>No matter what your dreams might be
<p>What you own is your own kingdom
<br>What you do is your own glory
<br>What you love is your own power
<br>What you live is your own story
<br>In your head is the answer
<br>Let it guide you along
<br>Let your heart be the anchor
<br>And the beat of your own song
