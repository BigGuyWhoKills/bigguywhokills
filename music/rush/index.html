<p>If you are here, then you probably know that Rush has had a big impact on my life. Easily my favourite (the 'u' is in honour of Geddy) group for many years now, I can sit down and listen to a disk and completely change my mood. Few other artists can do that, and none do it as well as Rush! <br>
There are a lot of sites on the WWW with plenty of resources for Rush fans, and I have no plan of competing with them (I don't have the time or patience), but I figure that with as much as I love this group I ought to have a simple page of links (mostly for my own convenience, heheheh).
<br>First off, I'm gonna start with the official web site: <a href="http://www.rush.com/">Rush.com</a>, then the label website at <a href="http://atlantic-records.com/rush/">Atlantic records</a>, and a discography <big><big><big><a href="rush_albums.html">here</a>
</big></big></big> on my own page. The original document was on the <a href="http://syrinx.umd.edu/rush/">Rush/NMS</a> site. Unfortunately, this site was closed in September of 1999. The National Midnight Star was my favourite Rush web page.
</p>
<p>Two of my favourite Rush web sites are <a href="http://www.neilpeart.com/">Niel's page</a> and <a href="http://www.geddylee.net/">Geddy's page</a>. I'm not afraid to say that I love these two for the unmeasurable amount of joy that they have poured into my life! Geddy has (had) a seperate page for his solo album, <a href="http://www.myfavoriteheadache.com/">My Favourite Headache</a>. - Update, seems Geddy has let that page go.  Visit GeddyLee.net instead.
</p>

<br>And here is the <a href="http://www.nimitz.net/rush/">FAQ</a>. This FAQ is NOT updated by the NMS, but links can be found to each page to the other.
