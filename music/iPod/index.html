<h1>I figured that I'd make a page about my iPods.</h1>

This is my 4G 60 Gig iPod photo and my 5G 60 Gig iPod video. &nbsp;It was pretty sweet using WinAmp to sync songs between the two, until I found that WinAmp messed up all the video that I had on the new iPod.<br>
The 5G also has a flat clear plastic face, rather than the rounded white face of previous models.<br>

/><br>
In this poor shot, you can see the the 5G doesn't have the data tab next to the headphone jack. &nbsp;This means my headphone remote control will not work on my new iPod (many people will not be able to use their iTrip or other accessories as well). &nbsp;I have no idea why Apple would take this away and not have an equivalent feature.<br>

	title="A shot showing how thin the new 5G iPods are"
/><br>
Another out of focus shot that shows how much thinner the 5G is compared to the 4G. &nbsp;I put the F.E.A.R. box behind them because the camera was focusing on the wall.<br>

Here's a shot of my new 4G hardshell case as well as my new Bang And Olufsen A8 headphones.<br>
<br>

These headphones sound excellent, look sweet, and you don't have to worry about sharing ear-wax when you let someone else listen. &nbsp;Machined aluminum FTW!<br>

/><br>
This is a neoprene case that I bought online. &nbsp;I love that it protects the click wheel without losing much sensitivity, but it didn't come with a screen protector! &nbsp;So I kinda made my own from a discarded 5G faceplate template.<br>
