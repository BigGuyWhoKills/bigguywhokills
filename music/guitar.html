On 15 Jan 2002 I bought a <a href="http://www.washburn.com/">Washburn</a> WR120 electric guitar.<br>

Here is what she looks like:<br>

<br>
I bought this guitar from Best In Music at the Provo mall, and with the purchase came 2 free lessons from Scott Miller Studios. 
I took the 2 free lessons, and am continuing on with my instructor Doug Collins.<br>
I haven't done anything custom to my Washburn yet, but I've decided that <a href="http://www.ernieball.com/">Ernie Ball</a> make the best guitar equipment that I've found.<br>
And I've already learned not to buy cheap cables.<br>
<br>
I am currently running this through a Ibanez ToneBlaster 15R, 15 watt amp with built in overdrive distortion and reverb.<br>

Once you have a guitar, you are gonna need some tabs. Guitar tab is a form of shorthand for guitar music. It consists of horizontal lines that represent your strings, and numbers on those lines designating which fret to press the string against to play.
<br>
Example: --4-2-0--  Hold your finger against the 4th fret, pick that string, then hold the 2nd fret and pick the string, and then pick the string open (not held agains the fretboard).
Played on the high 'e' string, this is part of the US National anthem.<br>
My favorite site for tab so far is <a href="http://www.tabcrawler.com/search/">Tab Crawler</a>.
<br>
You should also check out the <a href="http://www.olga.net/">OnLine Guitar Archive</a>.
<br>
And thanks to Tabcrawler and OLGA, I have more tab downloaded than I have time to learn to play them.<br>
<br>
Once you start using tabs, you HAVE to get <a href="http://powertab.guitarnetwork.org/downloads.htm">Power Tab</a>! Power Tab is the best tab editing and studying program I've found, and it's FREE!<br>
It lets you enter in your tab like any other tab program, but Power Tab shows you the traditional musical notation above your tab.<br>
It let's you set the tempo, time signature, notes and rests (from whole to 1/64th). It has a built in checker to see if you have errors (e.g. 3 quarter notes in a 4/4 measure will tell you that you are 1/4 under).<br>
It is fully configurable for nearly any guitar, fron 3 to 7 strings. It can also do Bass (3 to 5 string) and Drum tabs. In a single tab you can have 7 distinct guitars each with unique tunings. <br>
And it's list of guitar specific features (bend, hammer, slide, mute, rake, tremolo, etc...) is extensive. It even has an autosave feature.<br>
It also prints out beautiful sheet music of what you tabbed (or <a href="http://powertab.mytopsitelist.com/top25/">downloaded</a>). The printout looks very professional. Below is a screenshot of a single section. The printout of an entire page has the title, author, album and credits.<br>

And best of all, it has a built in MIDI 'gateway'. This feature lets you create tab from a MIDI file, and output your tab to a MIDI file. This lets you listen to your tab without picking up a guitar!<br>
Once you have Power Tab, goto <a href="http://us.geocities.com/rhythmyyz/index.html">Progressive Power Tabs</a> to get some <a href="rush/index.html">Rush</a> tabs.<br>
