I've been drumming since 5th grade, so you'd think that I'd be pretty good at it. That's what you get for thinking. Actually, I'm not half bad at it.<br>
When I was given the opportunity to take band, our teacher asked each of us what instrument we wanted to play. I was told that I had good teeth for a trumpet player, so I wanted to do that. But my parents couldn't afford to buy me a trumpet, so I was forced to play percussion, like my older brother had 7 years earlier. I was bummed out at this time, but in hindsight it was probably the best thing that could have happened to me.<br>
Eventually, my family moved to Provo UT, and that's where I was properly introduced to <a href="rush/index.html">Rush</a>! One of my friends in my Russian class was talking about them one day, so I asked him what album I should buy if I wanted to get a good representation of their music. He suggested that I listen to "Power Windows". I went out and bought it on tape, I was too poor at the time to pick it up on CD, and I was hooked. After that I went out and bought "Chronicles" on CD, and I listened to all of these songs that I had heard before and liked, but I had no idea that they were by Rush, I didn't even realize that they were all by the same artist. Remember that I grew up in a cultural black hole called Manson Washington. So my appreciation for Rush grew quickly, and since I had been a drummer for years by this point, I took a quick liking to Neil Peart. He is possibly the greatest rock drummer of all time. If you listen to a Rush song from the 2nd album on, and take note of the drumming, you will realize that this is not normal vanilla beat-keeping drumming. This is creative and interesting for a change. And if you try to emulate what you hear, you will realize that it takes more skill than you could have imagined possible.

Also, at Timpview high school in Provo, I was able to take drum line as one of my classes. This is where I learned a lot of drum technique.
