<h1>Turkey</h1>
I spent a week in Turkey in August of 2004.&nbsp; Here are some of the pictures from that trip.&nbsp; I have over 200 pictures from this trip, so posted here are only a few of my favorites.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="turkey12.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;"><br>
This wall was part of the old fortifications built about 2000 years ago.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="turkey27.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;"><br>
It's nice to know that I can get a crappy Big Mac nearly anywhere in the world.&nbsp; Note the lack of the McArches.&nbsp; I don't know what that is all about.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="turkey37.jpg" style="width: 480px; height: 640px;"><br>
This is one of the gates at the second palace of the Sultans.&nbsp; Walt Disney is a copying piece of $%&amp;$!<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="turkey57.jpg" style="width: 480px; height: 640px;"><br>
In the palace, we have the sword of King David of Israel (of David and Goliath fame) in the foreground.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="turkey62.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;"><br>
This innocent looking piece of wood is the staff of Moses.&nbsp; I have no idea how you verify a fact like this, but I was told that several religions accept this as truth.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="turkey72.jpg" style="width: 480px; height: 640px;"><br>
This is a pool in the Harem section of the Sultans palace.&nbsp; The Harem would bathe here, and I'm sure the Sultan enjoyed the view.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="turkey74.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;"><br>
Some cool 14th century (I think) rifles.&nbsp; I'll keep my AR15 though.&nbsp; The rifle laying horizontal has a bore of about 3 inches!<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="turkey76.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;"><br>
I was totally going to steal that sword, but we were out of time, so I didn't.<br>
You would be amazed at the things that we were not allowed to take pictures of in the palace.&nbsp; I was an emerald the size of a hen's egg!&nbsp; Not to mention all of the gold on display.&nbsp; For several centuries the Ottoman and Byzantine empires had their capitals here in Constantinople (Istanbul).&nbsp; This made the area effectively the capital of the world at that time.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="turkey82.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;"><br>
The view from a restaurant that we ate at.&nbsp; We were in Europe here, but across that river on the far bank, was the Asian part of Turkey.&nbsp; Ankara is in Asia, so when we visited Ankara we hit the second continent of the trip (third if you count the layover in Europe).<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="turkey84.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;"><br>
This souffle was the best desert that I've had in my life ever!&nbsp; It was served with a cream that you mix in with it, and if I wasn't already stuffed by all the swordfish that I had in the main course, I would have kept ordering these until..., heck, I'd still be in that restaurant now.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="dcp_2590.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 600px;"><br>
These aqueducts were built in Roman times, and are still functional though unused.&nbsp; They feed the cisterns of Istanbul, one of which is shown a few images below.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="dcp_2594.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 600px;"><br>
The mosque's in Turkey are astounding!&nbsp; Sorry but I didn't get the name of this one.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="dcp_2624.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 800px;"><br>
The largest chandelier that I've ever seen.&nbsp; This was in the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Hagia+Sophia&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8">Hagia Sophia</a>, and this area was being restored so it was off limits.&nbsp; If the link doesn't work, search for "Hagia Sophia" on <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="dcp_2643.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 600px;"><br>
This is just one example of the beautiful mosaics in the Hagia Sophia.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="dcp_2650.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 600px;"><br>
This is the "<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=Blue+Mosque&amp;sourceid=mozilla-search&amp;start=0&amp;start=0&amp;ie=utf-8&amp;oe=utf-8">Blue Mosque</a>", a world famous attraction that is considered one of the most holy Muslim sites in the world.&nbsp; This is (IMO) the most beautiful building in all of Turkey.&nbsp; When it was built, many considered it sacrilegious because it was the first mosque to have the same number of minarets as Mecca.&nbsp; Because of this it was built with it's defense in mind.&nbsp; Sadly, we didn't have time to tour it.&nbsp; This is another structure that you should <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a> for.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="dcp_2653.jpg" style="width: 600px; height: 800px;"><br>
This is an Egyptian style obelisk built in the 3rd century located in the Hippodrome.&nbsp; The was right next to the Blue Mosque and the Hagia Sophia.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="dcp_2660.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 600px;"><br>
This was were we had lunch on a small side street after visiting the Hagia Sophia.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="dcp_2664.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 600px;"><br>
This is the Basilica Cistern under Istanbul.&nbsp; The cisterns were used to keep water stored without evaporating, and were fed water by the aqueducts that are shown a few images above.&nbsp; The James Bond film "From Russia With Love" and Jackie Chan's "The Accidental Spy" had scenes shot here.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="dcp_2667.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 600px;"><br>
Andrew, Adam (me), and John in the cistern.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="dcp_2679.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 600px;"><br>
A local police officer that we got directions from.&nbsp; I think it's cool that they all have full-auto MP5's.&nbsp; Even bank guards have full auto MP5's.&nbsp; Heckler and Koch must love the business.&nbsp; I was being sly when I took this picture because I didn't know how he would feel about having his picture taken.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="dcp_2683.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 600px;"><br>
This is the view inside the Grand Bazaar in central Istanbul.&nbsp; There are about 4000 shops in here, and over 12000 employees.&nbsp; It's a small city unto itself.&nbsp; A lot of rug shops and jewelers.&nbsp; This is where I got most of my souvenirs and gifts for family members.&nbsp; Don't get lost.&nbsp; There are dozens of "streets" in here, but I was separated from my companions once, and had to meet up at the hotel.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="dcp_2684.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 600px;"><br>
A picture of one of the old streets just outside the Grand Bazaar.&nbsp; The main roads in Istanbul are much more modern obviously, but there are still plenty of cool back roads like this one.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="dcp_2689.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 600px;"><br>
Another very cool looking mosque.&nbsp; I seriously love the look of these buildings.<br>
<br>
<img alt="" src="turkey92.jpg" style="width: 640px; height: 480px;"><br>
In Ankara we found another amazing Mosque (I failed to get the name of this one), but couldn't find a good angle to get a picture from, so I took a "bank shot" in the reflection of a nearby building.&nbsp; I am seriously the coolest person I know.<br>
