<h1>United Arab Emirates</h1>
I spent a week (um, well, a week and a half) in the U.A.E. in 2004.&nbsp; This is a photolog of the trip.<br>
<br>
The sunrises in the Middle East are amazing:<br>
<a href="DSC01777.JPG"><img src="dsc01777_t.jpg"></a>
<br>
<br>
Here's a decent picture of the hotel that I stayed at in Sharja:<br>
<a href="DSC01778.JPG"><img src="dsc01778_t.jpg"></a>
<br>
<br>
Fast food is always available, even familiar fast food. &nbsp;I didn't ever try Domino's, but I had Chili's twice, and it was good (a <a href="http://www.mitchhedberg.net/">Mitch Hedberg</a> reference).<br>
<a href="DSC01799.JPG"><img src="dsc01799_t.jpg"></a>
<br>
<br>
Another sunrise, more magnificent than our sunsets here in Utah.<br>
<a href="DSC01804.JPG"><img src="dsc01804_t.jpg"></a>
<br>
<br>
Near the customer's site we would sometimes encounter camels that had wandered from a nearby village. &nbsp;Camels are slow and will not always move for automobiles, so you have to drive carefully around them.<br>
<a href="DSC01807.JPG"><img src="dsc01807_t.jpg"></a>
<br>
<br>
This is what the sandstorms are like during the day.<br>
<a href="DSC01812.JPG"><img src="dsc01812_t.jpg"></a>
<br>
<br>
This is the entrance to our customers site.<br>
<a href="DSC01814.JPG"><img src="dsc01814_t.jpg"></a>
<br>
<br>
The desert out here is nothing like the deserts of the western United States. &nbsp;This picture was taken from the bus that I rode to and back from the site.<br>
<a href="DSC01823.JPG"><img src="dsc01823_t.jpg"></a>
<br>
<br>
Even the overpasses out here are amazingly beautiful. &nbsp;Taken through the bus window and the quality suffers for it.<br>
<a href="DSC01825.JPG"><img src="dsc01825_t.jpg"></a>
<br>
<br>
I wish I had taken this picture 400 milliseconds sooner. &nbsp;As you can kind of tell, the traffic circles have some awesome architecture.<br>
<a href="DSC01828.JPG"><img src="dsc01828_t.jpg"></a>
<br>
<br>
The guys that I went out to train.<br>
<a href="DSC01829.JPG"><img src="dsc01829_t.jpg"></a>
<br>
<br>
This water fountain would spray water a good 200+ feet in the air. &nbsp;Anyone want to do the calculations on how much energy that would take?<br>
<a href="DSC01833.JPG"><img src="dsc01833_t.jpg"></a>
<br>
<br>
This is a riverside walkway under one of the overpasses near my hotel in Sharja. &nbsp;It was very clean and very beautiful. &nbsp;I was trying to get a good shot of the mosque down the way.<br>
<a href="DSC01835.JPG"><img src="dsc01835_t.jpg"></a>
<br>
<br>
The same overpass but obviously from the sidewalk over the river.<br>
<a href="DSC01837.JPG"><img src="dsc01837_t.jpg"></a>
<br>
<br>
Some cabbie is off-roading to get around the traffic slowed by the sandstorm.<br>
<a href="DSC01849.JPG"><img src="dsc01849_t.jpg"></a>
<br>
<br>
As you can tell, it's possible to navigate without learning Arabic. &nbsp;Of course, I have no idea what a "Corniche" is, other than guesses from the picture here, and neither does my spell-checker.<br>
<a href="DSC01852.JPG"><img src="dsc01852_t.jpg"></a>
<br>
<br>
I'd love to go back and visit again. &nbsp;Even the hassle of losing my passport wasn't too bad. &nbsp;I figure that it only took a day longer than it would have taken had I lost my passport in England where there would be no (well, little) language barrier. &nbsp;And heck, how many Americans can say they have a police report on them in Arabic? &nbsp;I should scan that and post it here.<br>
