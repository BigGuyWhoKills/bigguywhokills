<h2>Primary System</h2>

My <a href="http://www.cpuid.org/index.php">CPU-Z</a> Verified Database ID: <a href="http://valid.x86.fr/32ci8g">3201591</a>.<br>

<br>
<b>CPU and Mainboard:</b> My current system, is a 4GHz 8-core <a href="http://www.amd.com/">AMD FX-8350</a>, running on an <a href="http://www.asrock.com/">ASRock</a> <a href="http://www.asrock.com/mb/AMD/890FX%20Deluxe5/">890FX Deluxe5 motherboard</a>.<br>
<br>
<b>Operating System:</b> I dual-boot between Windows 7 and Debian 7.3. &nbsp;Windows is a good gaming OS, but Linux beats it in every other regard.<br>
<br>
<b>Memory:</b> Currently I have 16GB (4x4GB) of G.Skill DDR3 1600 running at 9-9-9-24 @ 1600 MHz.<br>
<br>
<b>Graphics Card:</b> I run a <a href="http://www3.pny.com/GTX-770-4096MB-OC2-PCIe-P3439C589.aspx">PNY GTX 770 4GB VCGGTX7704XPB-OC2</a>.<br>
<br>
<b>Monitor:</b> &nbsp;My current screens are three <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007BZ1092/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">27" ViewSonic VA2703-LED monitors</a>. &nbsp;These 3 monitors are all mounted to a single stand, so I'm nearly surrounded by monitors. &nbsp;I still miss my 21" <a href="http://www.viewsonic.com/">ViewSonic</a> A110, but a trio of 27" class wide screen LEDs take away some of that longing.<br>
<br>
<b>Audio:</b> I have been using onboard (motherboard) audio to drive my <a href="http://www.creativelabs.com/">Creative Labs</a> T7700 7.1 channel speaker system since about 2010, when my <a href="http://www.creativelabs.com/">Creative Labs</a> X-Fi Platinum finally died on me (purchased in 2008).<br>
<br>
<b>Storage:</b> I've given up on motherboard RAID, since its a nightmare to backup and restore if you don't have a lot of spare space elsewhere. &nbsp;I boot Win7 from a 1TB WD Blue, and boot Debian from a 1TB WD Black (The Blue is actually faster than the Black!). &nbsp;I have a <a href="http://www.3ware.com/3ware_home.htm">3Ware (LSI)</a> 9690SA-8I running a RAID5 array of four 3TB WD Red drives for about 12TB of aggregate space.  I have a few other drives in this system for storage, like a 1.5TB Seagate Barracuda and a 750GB Western Digital. &nbsp;This system has roughly 16TB of aggregate storage right now.<br>
<br>
<b>Optical:</b> I'm using a LG GGW-H20LK Blu-ray and DVD LightScribe SATA Burner and a LG 22X DVD±R SATA DVD Burner. &nbsp;The GGW-H20LK will also play HD-DVD disks (My only HD-DVD movie is Serenity).<br>
<br>
<b>LAN and WAN:</b> My ISP is Broadwave.&nbsp; I've <a href="http://www.dslreports.com/stest/">tested</a> at over 80 Mbps downstream and over 50 Mbps upstream. &nbsp;I connect the fiber box to an <a href="http://www.asus.com/us/Networking/RTAC66U">ASUS RC-AC66U</a> broadband router.&nbsp; This little beauty serves as a 4 port switch, a 802.11ac access point, a DHCP server, a router, and a simple hardware firewall all in one.&nbsp; It has many other features, and costs under $200, so I highly recommend picking one up.&nbsp; Because of this, the internet is always on, and I don't need to have proxy software always running on a computer.&nbsp; When friends come over, there is no squabbling over IP's, and everyone gets high speed internet.<br>
<br>
<b>Flight Stick:</b> I play flight simulators with my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00371R8P4/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Thrustmaster Warthog HOTAS</a>, and steer on the ground with my <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004ING996/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Saitek PRO Flight Combat Rudder Pedals</a>. &nbsp;In addition to those, I control my view with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/TrackIr-Premium-Head-Tracking-Gaming-Pc/dp/B0029M6VKA/ref=pd_bxgy_e_text_z">TrackIR 5</a>.<br>
<a href="http://www.saitek.com/">Saitek</a> X36F HOTAS flight control system.&nbsp; I don't use Saitek's crappy drivers though, I use Dhauzimmer's drivers found at <a href="http://saitekhelp.simhq.com/">Ron Hunt's Saitek help site</a>.<br>
<br>
<b>Control:</b> I control my system from across the room with my <a href="http://www.evation.com/irman/">Evation IRman</a>, <a href="http://www.girder.nl/">Girder software</a>, and a <a href="http://www.sony.com/">Sony</a> 7 device universal remote control. &nbsp;The X-Fi has a front panel IR receiver that I will also use for volume control.<br>
<br>
<b>Mouse and Keyboard:</b> I have a <a href="http://www.logitech.com/">Logitech</a> G9 laser mouse, and a <a href="http://www.logitech.com/index.cfm/products/details/US/EN,CRID=2166,CONTENTID=10717">Logitech G15 gaming keyboard that pwns</a>.<br>
<br>
<b>Case and PSU:</b> I have a <a href="http://www.coolermaster.com/">CoolerMaster</a> <a href="http://www.coolermaster.com/index.php?LT=english&amp;Language_s=2&amp;url_place=product&amp;p_serial=STC-T01&amp;other_title=STC-T01CM%20Stacker">Stacker 810</a>. &nbsp;My current PSU is a Corsair CMPSU-850TX 850W. &nbsp;I put this in because my <a href="http://www.antec.com/">Antec</a> <a href="http://www.antec.com/us/productDetails.php?ProdID=24480">NeoPower 550</a> and Sigma 535 Watt slaved together could not handle all the high current devices that I now have.<br>
<br>
<b>External Power:</b> The whole system is kept up with the aid of a CyberPower Intelligent LCD Series (model CP1500AVRLCD) 1500VA 900W UPS. It is amazing. &nbsp;I have penciled it into my will.<br>
<br>
<b>Capture:</b> I used to watch TV on an old <a href="http://www.hauppauge.com/">Hauppauge</a> NTSC tuner card (when I bothered to install it).<br>

<h2>Backup Computer</h2><br>
This machine keeps getting hand-me-down parts.
<br>
Here is my previous CPU-Z Verified Database ID: <a href="http://valid.x86-secret.com/show_oc?id=30441">30441</a>.<br>
<br>
<b>CPU and Mainboard:</b> This system is an Athlon 64 3500+ (Socket 939, NewCastle core) on a <a href="http://www.giga-byte.com/">Gigabyte</a> K8T Triton motherboard.<br>
<br>
<b>Video:</b> The video card is a PNY GeForce 7600GS 512MB that replaced my 6800 GT when it failed. &nbsp;The display is my <a href="http://www.viewsonic.com/">Viewsonic VX2235WM-3</a>. &nbsp;My <a href="http://www.viewsonic.com/products/desktopdisplays/lcddisplays/aseries/va1912wb/">VA1912wb 19" wide screen LCD</a> is now in the living room power the old Fedora 12 box I've got.<br>
<br>
<b>Memory:</b> Currently I have 2 Gig of RAM running Dual Channel at 128 bit. &nbsp;1 Gig of Elixir PC3200 DDR RAM (2x512), and 1 Gig of Corsair (2x512).<br>
<br>
<b>Storage:</b> The boot drive is a 250 Gig Seagate PATA100. &nbsp;I have two 160 Gig SATA drives that aren't being used anymore.<br>
<br>
<b>Optical:</b> I have an AOpen 16x DVD±RW and a Lite-On 16x DVD-ROM. &nbsp;I must say that I like my Lite-On DVD burner better than my AOpen DVD burner even though they have the same specs.<br>
<br>
<b>Mouse and Keyboard:</b> I have a Logitech dual-optical here, and an old generic keyboard.<br>
<br>
<b>Case and PSU:</b> I have a <a href="http://www.coolermaster.com/">CoolerMaster</a> <a href="http://www.coolermaster.com/index.php?LT=english&amp;Language_s=2&amp;url_place=product_list&amp;p_class=615">Centurion 5</a>, with its stock PSU.<br>

<a name="HTPC"></a>
<h2>HTPC</h2>

<b>CPU and Mainboard:</b> It uses an AMD Athlon 64 3000+ running on an <a href="http://www.asus.com/">Asus</a> motherboard.<br>
<br>
<b>Video:</b> The video card is a ATI All-In-Wonder 9600 that used to go out to my roommates 52" TV. &nbsp;But my roommate got married, so now its waiting on me to buy something worthy of an HTPC. &nbsp;This card has a standard (not hi-def) TV tuner built into it and has the ability to use a TV as a monitor.<br>
<br>
<b>Memory:</b> It has 512 Meg of Mushkin PC 3200 DDR RAM.<br>
<br>
<b>Storage:</b> I've got an <a href="http://www.storage.ibm.com/hdd/prod/deskstar.htm">IBM Deskstar</a> 45 Gig PATA 100 boot drive, and a Western Digital 160 Gig SATA drive for holding episodes of Lost, 24, and Alias.<br>
<br>
<b>Optical:</b> The optical drive is a Lite-On 16x DVD±RW.<br>

<h2>Past computers and history</h2>
The first system that I ever really used was a Commodore 64 that my dad bought for the family. &nbsp;Have I mentioned that my dad rules? &nbsp;Well, he does. &nbsp;Unless you are one of my siblings, you dad is at best 85% as cool as my dad. &nbsp;I played around with that C64 a bit, and even programmed a bouncing ball, but we didn't have any storage at that time, so when I powered it off, an hour's worth of work was gone. &nbsp;Later we got a tape drive (yes, a 4-track) and I was able to save my work. &nbsp;Few things are as frustrating as fast forwarding that tape for 3 minutes before realizing that you didn't reset the counter.<br>
<br>
A few years after that my grade school ordered five Apple II's. &nbsp;The school ordered these when I was in fifth grade, and for some reason the fifth grade classroom was where we kept them. &nbsp;It impresses me to this day that our small (and small-minded) town was able to justify that expense. &nbsp;I don't know how that got budgeted, but I'm eternally thankful. &nbsp;I did all sorts of programming on those, and stopped just as I was teaching myself graphics.<br>
<br>
A few years later, my brother Tom came home from college with his brand new Macintosh (128k, the very first one). &nbsp;This thing was deadly cool at the time. &nbsp;This was the first time I ever used a mouse, and I remember before he brought it home, he wrote me a letter telling me about the computer and the mouse. &nbsp;My primitive caveman mind couldn't figure out how it worked. &nbsp;What I had in my head was a rigid cord, and the ball being on the far end of it, in a socket on the back of the computer. &nbsp;Not quite as convenient as the ball being in the mouse itself. &nbsp;When my brother went on his mission, we kept the Mac at our house, and I got to use it quite a bit.<br>
<br>
The first system of my own was a 286 with half of its ram in 14 pin DIP's soldered to the motherboard, and the second half in 14 pin DIP's in sockets. &nbsp;That means you can go out and buy 14 pin DIP RAM chips to upgrade it. &nbsp;It was in one of those huge beige steel cases with the giant red power switch on the left side of the case near the back. &nbsp;I had a 5.25" floppy drive in it, and I later upgraded to a 3.5" drive. &nbsp;It had no hard drive. &nbsp;These were the days of booting DOS 5.0 from a floppy, and for the most part you didn't need a hard drive. &nbsp;The whole thing weighed about 400 lbs. &nbsp;This would have been sometime around 1995.<br>
<br>
I grew up using Mac's, and my only prior PC experience was on a roommates 286 (that had a 486 upgrade chip in it, and a hard drive). &nbsp;I used to play "LHX", a combat helicopter simulator that only needed a CGA display (9 pin, like a serial cable), rather than those fancy VGA adapters. &nbsp;I messed up that PC so bad. &nbsp;One time my roommate went on a week long trip, and said I could use his PC. &nbsp;I remember seeing a message on the screen: "Hit &lt;DEL&gt; to enter setup". &nbsp;After a few days, I decided to take its advice. &nbsp;I knew enough to cancel so the prior config would not be ruined. &nbsp;That worked out great, with one exception: the IDE configuration screen. &nbsp;When you went in to look at the IDE settings, if you entered the screen to change the settings, there was no cancel option! &nbsp;And to make that even worse, this screen covered the current settings screen, so I couldn't even set it back to how it was! &nbsp;Now, these were the days of limited hard drive types, and this motherboard had the standard list of 38 or so types, and then "custom". &nbsp;Well, none of the types worked properly, so it surely needed to be set in the custom settings. &nbsp;Now I was boned. &nbsp;I had no idea how many cylinders, heads, or sectors per track this drive had, and it wasn't labeled. &nbsp;Bear in mind that this was LONG before the days of HD auto-detection.<br>
<br>
Well, my only hope was to go to the library and look through computer books until I found a solution. &nbsp;Back in those days Peter Norton (of Symantec and Norton Utilities) put out quite a lot of books that contained about anything you would need to know in order to troubleshoot your PC. &nbsp;I learned a shload about computers from those books. &nbsp;But I still didn't find a solution in them. &nbsp;I finally stumbled onto a config that worked. &nbsp;At the time, I thought that something was still wrong, because the size listed in the BIOS didn't match what size my roommate told me or what I had seen in DOS earlier. &nbsp;Now I wonder if it was just the 1k vs. 1024 difference.<br>
<br>
A few months later I was lucky enough to pick up a 386 SX motherboard. &nbsp;The 386 was a huge step forward in chips because of its enhanced memory features. &nbsp;Not just that, but now I could play "Warcraft: Orcs and Humans"! &nbsp;I only had the demo, but that was more than enough to set the tone for the rest of my life.<br>
<br>
Eventually I got a 486, probably a SX at first, then a DX later, then a DX2-66, then a DX4-120, DX4-133, and so on. &nbsp;My first sound card was an 8-bit SoundBlaster that had no software volume control. &nbsp;You adjusted the volume with a small rotary knob on the back of the sound card.<br>
<br>
I remember buying my first 1 MB video card for one of my 486's. &nbsp;I went to some person's house in Provo, and gave him $100 for it. &nbsp;It was amazing how much better that card made my games. &nbsp;A while later, I bought a Diamond Monster 3D 3dfx Voodoo (launched in Nov 1996, I probably got it in '97 or '98). &nbsp;This was an add-on card that converted a 2D video signal to 3D.  &nbsp;The Monster 3D did not have a 2D engine. &nbsp;It used the existing video card, and included a pass-through cable. &nbsp;So the signal from the existing card went into the Monster 3D, and the Monster 3D added post-processing effects. &nbsp;At the next LAN party, one of the guys told me that the Monster 3D allowed me to run GL Quake, so we downloaded the OpenGL patch for Quake and fired up the game. &nbsp;Holy crap, that was amazing! (at least for the time) &nbsp;All of the light sources had a cool glow effect around them, even the lava! &nbsp;At the next LAN party, about half the guys had upgraded their video cards.<br>
<br>
Since I upgrade so often, the PC that I have now is quite possibly just the upgraded 286 that I was first given so many years ago. &nbsp;I surely have had "overlapping" hardware through every upgrade.<br>
<br>
I have long been a devout follower of AMD, Asus, Logitech, Creative Labs, Antec, nVidia, ViewSonic, and others.
