<h1> Radio Controlled Hobbies </h1>

<blockquote><font size="+1">I love flying, so it was natural for me to take up R/C aircraft.</font>
  <p><font size="+1">I started out in high school with an electric r/c glider. This was a Carl Goldberg Electra (I had to remove the link, as Carl Goldberg Models is now owned by a pron site). &nbsp;How is that for a grim sign of the times.<br>
  <img src="carl_goldberg_electra.jpg" style="height: 269px; width: 350px;" alt="Carl Goldberg Electra" title="Carl Goldberg Electra"><br>
I controlled it with a 4 channel Futaba 'Attack 4' AM radio.</font> </p>
  <p> <font size="+1">After beating the Electra to death with hard landings, I moved up to a gas powered trainer, the <a href="http://store.yahoo.com/ehobbies-com/1000-1315.html">Great Planes PT40</a>.<br>
  <img src="great_planes_pt40.jpg" style="width: 322px; height: 146px;" alt="Great Planes PT40" title="Great Planes PT40"><br>
Again I used my trusty Futaba to control the power provided by my slightly used Enya .40 (ringed).</font> <font size="+1">Anybody that knows me, will not be surprised that I tried to learn to fly completely on my own. When I first flew that PT40, the control surfaces had far too much deflection, and consequently, the craft was as squirrelly as a plane can get. I crashed it after about 4 seconds in the air. Luckily, 4 seconds wasn't enough time to build up much speed, and the crash was a soft one, as far as crashes go.</font> <br>
  <font size="+1">I flew the PT40 for about 2 years before doing more damage to it than I wanted to fix.</font> </p>
  <p> <font size="+1">My next plane was another trainer. This was a .40 sized ARF, powered by a .40 OS Max, but I have forgotten the make and model of the plane. What fun I had that day. Yes, day. As in ONE day. I had a few good flights at the field in Lehi, but the wind was getting stronger, and my common sense seems to be inversely proportional to the current wind speed. I thought, "I can fly in this". Well, I couldn't. I decided as I was bringing it around, to pull the nose under and out, rather than continue the slow bank turn I was half way through. The plane would have made the maneuver on a calm day, but as the planes nose faced the ground, the large wings had too much wind encouraging them to give up altitude, and I powered into a thicket.</font> </p>
  <p> <font size="+1">At this point, my skills were much better, even though I had gone through a few planes in a short period of time. So I decided it was time to try a sport plane (and a taildragger at that). I picked up a <a href="http://www.ehobbies.com/1000-0510.html">Hanger 9 Ugly Stick ARF</a>, and powered it a with my trusty OS .40 engine.<br>
  <img src="hanger_9_super_stick_40.jpg" style="width: 250px; height: 129px;" alt="Hanger 9 Super Stick .40" title="Hanger 9 Super Stick .40"><br>
This plane had two days of flying before it became balsa shrapnel. The story behind this crash goes as follows. I had about 3 flights down that day already, and was on my 4th when the clevis on the elevator disconnected from it's pushrod. With no elevator control, the plane continued on it's last course. Which in this case was an inverted power dive directed at the end of the runway (Lehi field). I have never seen a more spectacular event in my life. The plane was instantly transformed into hundreds of balsa splinters. Since the plane was inverted for the dive, my beloved OS .40 was to take a large portion of the impact. It was damaged beyond repair, and is now a paperweight on my desk at work.</font><br>
  <font size="+1">This was VERY discouraging. At the time I was working at Starways, and it's hard enough to live on $7.50 an hour, but even more difficult to live on that AND replace expensive R/C equipment. This meant that it would take quite a while to get back in the sport.</font> </p>
  <p> <font size="+1">Slowly I purchased the required parts to get flying again.</font> </p>
  <p> <font size="+1">I decided that I liked taildraggers, but I was tired of .40's. So I bought a <a href="http://www.ehobbies.com/1000-0511.html">Hanger 9 .60 sized Ugly Stick ARF</a>.<br>
  <img src="hanger_9_super_stick_60.jpg" style="width: 244px; height: 121px;" alt="Hanger 9 Super Stick .60" title="Hanger 9 Super Stick .60"><br>
About one paycheck later, I had enough saved to buy an OS .61, and I put it in the Ugly Stick. Now I had a new plane, and a new engine, so the next logical step was to buy a new radio. I wanted to switch to FM, and the entry level computer radio's looked like the answer. After a little research, I decided on a <a href="http://www.horizonhobby.com/products/description.asp?Prod=JRP6622**">JR XP652</a>.<br>
  <img src="jr_xp652.jpg" style="width: 219px; height: 254px;" alt="JR XP652" title="JR XP652"><br>
This is a 6 channel, 5 model memory, 2 mode (Heli/Plane) programmable FM/PCM controller. I highly recommend it to anyone in the market for an entry level computer radio.</font> </p>
  <p> <font size="+1">I flew this plane for a few years (I still have it now), but something was missing. At this point I was reaching an intermediate level of flying proficiency, and the challenge of flight was lessening, so I wasn't very encouraged to get out and fly. Another problem was the difficulty in finding a place to fly. In Utah valley, there are two fields designated just for R/C planes. The Lehi field requires AMA membership, which I don't have, and the field in Spanish Fork is not always open. You can get a key by joining the local club, but again, I just want to go somewhere and fly. I just spent all this money getting a new plane ready, and here are hoops to jump through before I can fly at a proper field.</font> </p>
  <p> <font size="+1">When I was buying the parts for this plane, Eric and Jeremy at <a href="http://www.worldclassmodels.com/">World Class Models</a> kept on egging me to get into helicopters. I know that this was the next logical step, but the cost and difficulty was rather prohibitive.</font> <br>
  <font size="+1"> Finally, I decided that my plane was not getting used, so I might as well try something new. So on March 31st of 2001, I bought a <a href="http://www.acehobby.com/products/helicopter/raptor30/index.html">Thunder Tiger Raptor .30</a> helicopter.<br>
  <img src="thunder_tiger_raptor_30.jpg" style="width: 388px; height: 198px;" alt="Thunder Tiger Raptor .30" title="Thunder Tiger Raptor .30"><br>
It took me quite a while to purchase all the items needed, but I was finally ready to fly it in May 2001. After an extensive pre-flight check, Jeremy and I fired up the Raptor, and he began the setup of the controls and gyro. I can't express enough the value of their expertise in helping get that model flying.</font> <br>
  <font size="+1"> The best part of flying helicopters, is that I can fly almost anywhere! I can fly at the hobby shop, almost any school yard, any park, or even a medium sized parking lot.</font> <br>
  <font size="+1"> I run an <a href="http://www.osengines.com/engines/osmg1940.html">OS .32 engine</a>,<br>
  <img src="os_32sx-h.jpg" style="width: 248px; height: 216px;" alt="OS .32SX-H" title="OS .32SX-H"><br>
with a <a href="http://www.hatori-models.co.jp/">Hatori</a> tuned pipe and header, which makes a bit less noise than a muffler, so that is one less obstacle. Unfortunately those huge main blades cutting through the air compensate for any quietness.</font> <br>
  <font size="+1">I control the buzzsaw with my JR XP652, a JR 649 9 channel receiver,</font><br>
  <img src="jr_r649.jpg" style="width: 250px; height: 211px;" alt="JR 649 receiver" title="JR 649 receiver"><br>
  <font size="+1">and the tail is kept in check with my JR G550T gyro.</font><br>
  <img src="jr_g550t.jpg" style="width: 250px; height: 182px;" alt="JR G550T" title="JR G550T"><br>
  <br>
<font size="+1">I am now able to fly well, without a rotopod or other training gear. I am very comfortable with tail-in flight, and on July 5th 2001, I was able to break through the mental barrier that kept me from flying nose-in.<br>
Now I am working on perfecting nose-in flight, and then I will work on my transitions from nose-in to tail-in, and then, pirouettes.<br>
4 Sept 2001: I have nose in flight down pretty well.  And my transitions from tail in to nose in and visa versa are getting better every time out. My pirouettes are getting better. If I do a slow 180 pirouette, I can keep the center of mass in nearly the exact position through the whole turn.<br>
10 Sept 2001: I changed the pitch on my Raptor. Holy crap! I am now running at +12&ordm; and -8&ordm;. It's now like a little buzzsaw, it has so much headspeed! This little decapitation toy is now almost too much for me to control.<br>
Oct 2001: I bought RealFlight G2, and I love it! In just a few days, my flying has improved drastically. I have tried a bunch of the tricks that I don't dare attempt in real life. Also, I can practice tedious training steps in any weather, at any time I like.<br>
Nov 2001: I haven't flown my Raptor much, RealFlight is largely to blame. But when I do fly the Raptor, I am pleased with the improvements that I am seeing.<br>
March 2002: The weather is getting warmer, and my mind now starts to return to the idea of flying my helicoptor in real life, rather than <a href="http://www.realflight.com/">RealFlight</a>. <br>
13 Feb 2003: I crashed real good on Tuesday the 11th. I was actually having a very good lunch break, and flying rather aggressively, when about half way through my second tank, my Raptor started pirouetting. The problem was that I wasn't putting in the inputs for the pirouette. In the end I found that the tail rotor hub set screws had both worked loose, through the threadlocker. This resulted in the tail rotor assuming a pitch, and not being able to restore to neutral. I was fortunate that the Raptor was rather level, and this kept it from flying off too far. I tried to get it to come down gently in a nearby field, but it started to drift away in the wind, and soon it hit a tree. This tree was right on the edge of the Provo river, and my helicopter went into the cold February water.<br>
My assessment of the damage seems to be good overall. I will definitely need to replace the frame pieces, main rotor blades, flybar, landing skids, and I may have lost my JR G550T from water damage. I think that the engine will be fine, and the receiver is working properly already.  Most of the broken parts are included in the V2 conversion kit, so I'll probably just take that route.<br>
28 Feb 2003: I finished my assesment of the damage, and I only need to replace the frame, landing skids, flybar, and 2 servos. I've already bought the V2 conversion, and have it partially installed. I'm going to steal 2 servos from one of my planes, and I hope to have the helicopter finished this weekend. <br>
6 Mar 2003: I finished the V2 conversion/rebuild, and am ready to fly it, but I noticed a 'stuttering' in the driveline that I want to address before I fly it. <br>
10 Mar 2003: The 'stuttering' may be caused by a bad bearing. The lower starter shaft bearing may not be air worthy. <br>
31 Mar 2003: I've flown the helicopter a few times after tightening the tail belt, and the 'stuttering' seems to be minimized, and it doesn't happen at higher RPM's. So after much practice, I am going to try a quick backflip. This will be my first inverted maneuver ever! I'm going to try it today after work. It get's me nervous, kinda like asking out a very pretty woman. </font><br>
