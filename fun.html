<center><h1>Look at all the great things to do in Provo / Orem!</h1></center>
Unfortunately there is practically nothing to do in this valley. After you have been here for a month or so it seems that you've done it all. But we can't give up without a fight, so here are some options that you may not have considered.<br>
<br>
First, you can always count on a movie to numb the brain for an hour or two, so check out <a href="http://www.desnews.com/">Deseret News</a>.<br>
<br>
Another way to spend time and money was playing paintball at Predator Paintball. &nbsp;I'm sorry, but they have gone out of business, and that is a real shame. &nbsp;This was probably the best couple of bucks you could spend in the valley. &nbsp;For your money, they would equip you with a gun, 50 paintballs, protective gear, and a short instruction course focusing on safety, and the rules regarding 'kills'. &nbsp;You could buy more than the original 50 paintballs that they gave you (you would get 50 for each hour you rent the equipment), but it could get expensive. &nbsp;Example: My friend and I went in one time, and at the end of the day he had spent about $25 (for 3 hours), whereas I spent $65. &nbsp;The difference, he was very careful with his ammo, and I went nuts with mine. &nbsp;I still play paintball. &nbsp;Now I own a Piranha STS G2, running Nitrous through a remote.<br>
<br>
You can also pick up some <a href="rc/index.html">RC</a> equipment and go flying or boating (or cars, if you're afraid of a real challenge). &nbsp;I fly a <a href="rc/raptor_10.jpg">Thunder Tiger Raptor .30</a> helicopter.<br>

<center><h1>Fun things to do elsewhere!</h1></center>

Online are a few fun distractions.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.homestarrunner.com/sbemail.html">Strong Bad</a> is my new favorite.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/">Penny Arcade</a> is another great one. &nbsp;Crap, just check out my <a href="webcomics.html">webcomics page</a>.<br>
