OggEnc2.2 (libVorbis 1.0 GT3b1)
(c) 2000-2003 Michael Smith, John Edwards & Gian-Carlo Pascutto

Usage: oggenc [options] input.wav [...]

OPTIONS:
 General:
 -Q, --quiet          Produce no output to stderr
 -h, --help           Print this help text
 -r, --raw            Raw mode. Input files are read directly as PCM data
 -B, --raw-bits=n     Set bits/sample for raw input. Default is 16
 -C, --raw-chan=n     Set number of channels for raw input. Default is 2
 -R, --raw-rate=n     Set samples/sec for raw input. Default is 44100
 --raw-endianness     1 for bigendian, 0 for little (defaults to 0)
 -b, --bitrate        Choose a nominal bitrate to encode at. Attempt
                      to encode at a bitrate averaging this. Takes an
                      argument in kbps. This uses the bitrate management
                      engine, and is not recommended for most users.
                      See -q, --quality for a better alternative.
 -m, --min-bitrate    Specify a minimum bitrate (in kbps). Useful for
                      encoding for a fixed-size channel.
 -M, --max-bitrate    Specify a maximum bitrate in kbps. Useful for
                      streaming applications.
 -q, --quality        Specify quality between -2 (low) and 10 (high),
                      instead of specifying a particular bitrate.
                      This is the normal mode of operation.
                      Fractional qualities (e.g. 2.75) are permitted
 --resample n         Resample input data to sampling rate n (Hz)
 --downmix            Downmix stereo to mono. Only allowed on stereo
                      input.
 --rehuff             Do a second 'rehuff' pass on the .ogg file for
                      improved compression. ****EXPERIMENTAL OPTION.
 -s, --serial         Specify a serial number for the stream. If encoding
                      multiple files, this will be incremented for each
                      stream after the first.

 Naming:
 -o, --output=fn      Write file to fn (only valid in single-file mode)
 -n, --names=string   Produce filenames as this string, with %a, %t, %l,
                      %n, %d replaced by artist, title, album, track number,
                      and date, respectively (see below for specifying these).
                      %% gives a literal %.
 -X, --name-remove=s  Remove the specified characters from parameters to the
                      -n format string. Useful to ensure legal filenames.
 -P, --name-replace=s Replace characters removed by --name-remove with the
                      characters specified. If this string is shorter than the
                      --name-remove list or is not specified, the extra
                      characters are just removed.
                      Default settings for the above two arguments are platform
                      specific.
 -c, --comment=c      Add the given string as an extra comment. This may be
                      used multiple times.
 -d, --date           Date for track (usually date of performance)
 -N, --tracknum       Track number for this track
 -t, --title          Title for this track
 -l, --album          Name of album
 -a, --artist         Name of artist
 -G, --genre          Genre of track
                      If multiple input files are given, then multiple
                      instances of the previous five arguments will be used,
                      in the order they are given. If fewer titles are
                      specified than files, OggEnc will print a warning, and
                      reuse the final one for the remaining files. If fewer
                      track numbers are given, the remaining files will be
                      unnumbered. For the others, the final tag will be reused
                      for all others without warning (so you can specify a date
                      once, for example, and have it used for all the files)
 -p, --padding n      Number of kilobytes of padding to provide in comment
                      header for post-encoding tagging. (0 - 4 permitted)

INPUT FILES:
 OggEnc input files must currently be 16 or 8 bit PCM WAV, AIFF, or AIFF/C
 files, or 32 bit IEEE floating point WAV. Files may be mono or stereo
 (or more channels) and any sample rate.
 With this version, you may also input FLAC, MONKEYS AUDIO, WAVPACK, LAPC,
 OPTIMFROG and SHORTEN files. You MUST ensure that the appropriate
 encoder/decoder (i.e., flac.exe, etc) is in the same dir/folder as
 oggenc, or is in the defined path.
 Alternatively, the --raw option may be used to use a raw PCM data file, which
 must be 16bit stereo little-endian PCM ('headerless wav'), unless additional
 parameters for raw mode are specified.
 You can specify taking the file from stdin by using - as the input filename.
 In this mode, output is to stdout unless an output filename is specified
 with -o
