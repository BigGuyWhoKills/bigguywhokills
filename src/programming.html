	<h1>Programming</h1>
	Commodore 64: I started programming in the 80's, on the family Commodore 64. &nbsp;Originally, we had no non-volatile storage.  So after programming for dozens of minutes and running my program, when I turned the computer off that program was gone. &nbsp;Eventually we got a tape drive. &nbsp;Not a reel to reel, but a 4-track cassette tape deck. &nbsp;It used blank audio tapes to save data to. &nbsp;You kept track of where data was by its counter position. &nbsp;Remember the little speedometer counters on your boom box? &nbsp;We had to write that number down on the cassette liner, and make sure the counter was reset when the tape was fully rewound. &nbsp;I do not remember if it was double-sided or not.<br>
	<br>
	Apple II: When I started 5th grade, our small school in Washington bought 5 Apple II computers. &nbsp;Coincidentally, these were kept in our classroom. &nbsp;This allowed me to have a lot of access to these computers, and to program with them. &nbsp;By the end of the year, I was at about the limit of what I thought could be done with text, and was ready to start graphical work.<br>
	<br>
	Macintosh: When my brother went to college, he bought a 128k Macintosh. &nbsp;I did not program on that, but it introduced me to my first graphical OS.<br>
	<br>
	Linux: In my senior year of high school, I was able to take a programming class that used Unix workstations connected to a server. &nbsp;This was my first work in C. &nbsp;I did well, but did not retain much due to not programming for several years.<br>
	<br>
	Wintel: Also during my senior year, I was able to play games on a friend's computer. &nbsp;While I did not write any programs, it taught me a little bit of MS DOS and Windows 3.x.<br>
	<br>
	I received my first PC as a gift from my friend Jon's father. &nbsp;It was a 286 with half of it's memory soldered to the motherboard, and half in 14 pin DIP sockets. &nbsp;I relentlessly upgraded that beast, a few parts at a time, as finances allowed.<br>
	<br>
	My first real programming class was a Programming for Electrical Engineers class at Utah Valley State College (now Utah Valley University). &nbsp;That class covered C. &nbsp;My final project for that class was a simple sprite game that utilized Borland Graphics Interface to draw your player character and a monster that chased you. &nbsp;There was no way to win. &nbsp;A later semester covered Intel Assembly Language.<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	I have studied C, C++, C#, Assembly, JavaScript, and am currently studying Java (fall 2015). &nbsp;I have taught myself a bit of Basic as a teenager, but I do not consider myself proficient in it.<br>
