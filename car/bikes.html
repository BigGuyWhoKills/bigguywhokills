<h1>Bikes</h1>
<div style="text-align: left;">My two roomates each have <a href="http://www.hondamotorcycle.com/">Honda Shadow motorcycles</a>.&nbsp; No big deal right?&nbsp; Well, one day Cliff let me ride his 1100cc Shadow Sabre, and now I have to own one of my own.&nbsp; This is really one of those things that you will never really appreciate until you take even a short cruise around town.&nbsp; That's all that I did on Cliff's bike (while he rode Marcus' 1800cc VTX), and now I can't wait to buy one.<br>
<br>
Right now I am considering 3 brands: <a href="http://www.harley-davidson.com/">Harley Davidson</a>, <a href="http://www.hondamotorcycle.com/">Honda</a>, and <a href="http://www.yamaha-motor.com/">Yamaha</a>.&nbsp;
I'd love a Harley because it's American made and a legend, but they run about 50% more than a Japanese bike.&nbsp; I would like a Honda because I've riden Cliff's, it rides nice, and has as much power as I'll ever need.&nbsp; And I'd like a Yamaha because our family has owned Yamaha for many years, and I think their engines look the best of all the cruisers.&nbsp; My next step is to take a few test rides, to see if there are any ride differences that I should be aware of.&nbsp; This will also be the best way to test the torque and power of the engines.<br>
