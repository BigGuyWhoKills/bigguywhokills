<b>My favorite way to get around is in a 1967 Mustang GT 500 (Boss 302).<br>
But I don't have one. &nbsp;I'm borrowing a one of my dad's cars, a convertible Miata that we <a href="2010_Miata.html">recently painted</a>.<br>
I am currently shopping for a 1999 or later Mustang GT convertible.</b><br>

<div align="center"><h2>Stereo</h2>
</div>
<b>To start off, here are a few links for car audio:<br>
- <a href="http://www.caraudioforum.com/">CarAudioForum.com</a> .<br>
- <a href="http://www.bcae1.com/">Basic Car Audio Electronics by Perry Babin</a> .<br>
- <a href="http://www.sounddomain.com/">Sound Domain</a>, a great online retail shop.<br>

<br>
The best thing about my car is that it sounds real good.&nbsp; No, not the engine, the stereo.&nbsp; That reminds me, I need to get the engine fixed.&nbsp; But the stereo is nice.&nbsp; It's not setup to compete with the thump thump boys you hear around town, but my music sounds good (better than many thump systems), and I don't set off car alarms 2 blocks away.
<br>
<br>
<center>My head unit is a <a href="http://www.pioneerelectronics.com/">Pioneer</a> DEH-31 (35x4).&nbsp; I know that I need to replace this, but my opinion is that decks are just on the verge of being exactly what I want.  Here is a list of features that I dream about:
<ul>
<li>A large, non volatile storage device (at least 1 TB), preferably solid state memory.</li>
<li>It should be able to read all popular media from Bluray to CD, Compact Flash, SD, etc..., and be able to upgrade it's firmware to play new audio and video formats.</li>
<li>BlueTooth phone interface to pause/mute when a phone call comes in, and give the option of hands-free use through the stereo speakers and a microphone.</li>
<li>802.11n or BlueTooth networking so I can add tracks from inside the house.&nbsp; The car stereo should show up on the network just like any other shared storage device on the network.</li>
<li>It should have a simple color touch screen large enough to be useful for GPS navigation and basic network functions.&nbsp; The 802.11 adapter will allow you to perform those functions (like simple web browsing, FTP, telnet, etc...) remotely.</li>
<li>A detachable face that doubles as a PMP with enough storage to be used as a sneakernet method of adding tracks.</li>
<li>More features to come...</li>
</ul>
<br>
I really want one of the <a href="http://www.eclipse-web.com/">Eclipse</a> decks.  Maybe I will buy one of those while I wait for the industry to come out with a deck that has the features that I crave.

I will replace this when decks get noticeably better.&nbsp; I know, I know, MP3 is a great reason to upgrade, but I own over 500 CD's so I don't really need MP3 disks.
<br>
<br>
From there I send my speaker level outputs to a set of <a href="http://www.infinitysystems.com/caraudio/product.aspx?ProdId=%27REF4002I%27&amp;Ser=REF&amp;Cat=MEL">4" Infinity Reference</a> (4002i) series dash speakers.

<br>
<br>
The pre-amp output from the deck goes to a <a href="http://www.coustic.com/">Coustic</a> <a href="http://www.coustic.com/products/processors/XM6.cfm">XM6</a> crossover.
<br>
<a href="http://www.coustic.com/products/processors/XM6.cfm"><img src="coustic_xm6.jpg" width="320" heigth="336"></a>
<br>
<br>
From there I move the lower frequencies to my new (Feb 2004) <a href="http://www.coustic.com/">Coustic</a> <a href="http://www.coustic.com/products/amplifiers/801DB.cfm">801DB</a> (800 Watt RMS) Amplifier, and my mids and highs to my Pioneer <a href="http://www.pioneerelectronics.com/Pioneer/CDA/CarProducts/CarProductDetails/0,1429,21381,00.html">GM-X262</a> 200 watt amplifier.

<br>
<br>
The 801DB drives my <a href="http://www.infinitysystems.com/caraudio/product.aspx?ProdId=%27KAPPA+PERFECT12.1%27&amp;Ser=KPE&amp;Cat=SUB">Infinity Perfect 12</a> subwoofer (4 ohm, SVC) from 20Hz to 150Hz, and the XM-262 drives my rear deck of <a href="http://www.infinitysystems.com/caraudio/product.aspx?ProdId=%27REF6002I%27&amp;Ser=REF&amp;Cat=MEL">Infinity Reference 6.5"</a> (6002i) speakers from 100Hz to 300Hz.

<br>
All in all, the balance is great! The system can thump, but I am trying to get it set it up for fidelity.
<br>
<br>
I've put in a false floor in the trunk of the Audi.&nbsp; This protects my system from all the stuff that I put in my trunk.&nbsp; Next I will amplify all of the full range speakers with <a href="http://www.coustic.com/">Coustic</a> amps.&nbsp; I will probably use a <a href="http://www.coustic.com/">Coustic</a> <a href="http://www.coustic.com/products/amplifiers/481QE.cfm">481QE</a>.

<h2>Now, some pics of my car stereo install in my old Audi Model 80:</h2>
<img style="width: 1000px; height: 750px;" alt="" src="dcp_2071.jpg">
<br>
This was the first set of quality battery terminals that I was using on my Audi.&nbsp; They are StreetWire terminals, and in this picture they are just running 8 gauge positive (Yes, for the entire car, engine and all. &nbsp;<a href="../guns/index.html">Don't laugh, I am not well adjusted</a>.) and 4 gauge ground.<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 1000px; height: 750px;" alt="" src="dcp_2072.jpg">
<br>
This picture shows both terminals.&nbsp; Notice how close the positive terminal is to the frame.&nbsp; That's unsafe, even though the battery was very secure.&nbsp; Later I replaced this with a fused battery terminal (see below).<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 1000px; height: 750px;" alt="" src="dcp_2073.jpg">
<br>
This is the false floor in place, with just my sub in the trunk.
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 1000px; height: 750px;" alt="" src="dcp_2074.jpg">
<br>
This is my first electronics board.&nbsp; At this time I didn't have my 801DB, so I made a board out of some scrap particle board that I had left over from cutting the false floor.
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 1000px; height: 750px;" alt="" src="dcp_2075.jpg">
<br>
Here is the false floor in place.&nbsp; My electronics are totally protected from all of these tools and anything else I put in here.
<br>
<br>
.<img style="width: 1000px; height: 750px;" alt="This is my current system in the trunk of the Audi." title="My wife and kids" src="dcp_2460.jpg">
<br>
This is my new electronics board (4 April 2004).&nbsp; My nephew Ryan and I put together this setup in an afternoon, carpet and all.&nbsp; This components are a Coustic XM6, a Pioneer <a href="http://www.pioneerelectronics.com/Pioneer/CDA/CarProducts/CarProductDetails/0,1429,21381,00.html">GM-X262</a>, and a Coustic 801DB.
<br>
Power comes in on 0 gauge wire on the left side of the chassis and signal comes in on 20' Monster Cable on the right side of the chassis.&nbsp; Ground is currently 4 gauge, but I will change that to 0 gauge when I have bought the proper grounding lug.&nbsp; All power from the distribution blocks run under the board, and all signal between devices runs under the board as well (avoiding other lines, or crossing at 90º where possible).
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 1000px; height: 750px;" alt="This is a picture of my Inifinty Perfect 12 (4 ohm, SVC) sitting on my trunk with the rest of my system behind it." title="My Infinity Perfect 12 (4 ohm, SVC)" src="dcp_2461.jpg">
<br>
Here is a shot of my Infinity Perfect 12 (4 ohm, SVC) with my system in the background.
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 1000px; height: 750px;" alt="This is my battery post terminal." title="Phoenix Gold battery terminal" src="dcp_2462.jpg">
<br>
I just love this Phoenix Gold battery terminal!&nbsp; It has two 0 gauge outputs and a single 4 gauge output, so I can easily hook up everything in my car.&nbsp; It is also fused right on the terminal, making it extremely safe.&nbsp; The negative terminal is a 4 gauge Streetwires, which I will swap out with a Phoenix Gold 0 gauge soon.
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 1000px; height: 750px;" alt="I love my trunk!." title="My amp rack as of 2004-05-15" src="dcp_2501.jpg">
<br>
Here is my amp rack as of 15 May 2004.&nbsp; All pre-amp signal is now transferred over Monster Cable THX RCA's.&nbsp; The only thing I want to add to this is a replacement for the Pioneer amp.
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 1000px; height: 750px;" alt="These are my battery post terminals." title="Phoenix Gold battery terminals and grounding lug" src="dcp_2505.jpg">
<br>
I love having both of these Phoenix Gold battery terminals!&nbsp; I also have a PG 1/0 gauge grounding lug (and a matching lug in the trunk).&nbsp; You can see that I replaced the 4 gauge StreetWires terminal.&nbsp; I will shorten this ground wire by a few inches so it doesn't pose any interference threat to the throttle linkage.&nbsp; Then I need to run the positive wire through some other route, because this is too close to both the coil and the distributor.&nbsp; I think those vents just behind it might be the best route (I don't recommend to anyone that they block ANY vent in their car).
<br>
<br>
<img style="width: 1000px; height: 750px;" alt="This is my trunk with everything out of it." title="Clean trunk install" src="dcp_2507.jpg">
<br>
This is my trunk without my tools inside.&nbsp; I carpeted the false floor and used 2x4's to stiffen it so it no longer sags under the weight of my tools and sub.&nbsp; You can also see my Monster Cable "Flex Pins" going into the Q-Logic 12" box.&nbsp; These are a much better solution than just bare wire.
