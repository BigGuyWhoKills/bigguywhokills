I took this picture after my third day of playing (2005-01-11). &nbsp;If you look at the filename of the image, it indicates what date and time that the picture was taken (06:26). &nbsp;Yes, I only had about 2 hours of sleep that day before work.<br>

Remember how cool ballista's were in WCII? &nbsp;I never realized how large they were until I stood right next to one. &nbsp;No wonder they could kill an Ogre with one shot!<br>

I am very pleased that this game has a low overhead, and it allows high frame-rates on most machines. &nbsp;Looks like I need some anti-aliasing though.<br>

Here I am at lvl 9. &nbsp;This was after one or two days of playing.<br>

Here I am at lvl 23. &nbsp;This is where I got <a href="http://www.thottbot.com/?i=4190">Verigan's Fist</a> from my lvl 20 Paladin quest. &nbsp;I love 2 handed maces.<br>

I also made a Night Elf Rogue on Frostwolf, though I rarely play him. &nbsp;I have him mostly to know more about what rogues can do. &nbsp;I'm a Paladin at heart and Rogues scare me. &nbsp;Sneaky bastards.<br>

Here I am at lvl 29. &nbsp;I now have armor from the "Auction House" (AH) that gives me a bonus to agility on all of my pieces. &nbsp;My chance to crit went from about 4% to 8.77%! &nbsp;Since I'm a pally, I don't have to save up for my mount. &nbsp;I can completely ignore <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/news.php3?date=2005-02-02#2413">Gabe and Tycho's advice!</a> &nbsp;(<a href="http://216.239.57.104/search?q=cache:ZqiVWkr_3TUJ:penny-arcade.com/news.php3%3Fdate%3D2005-02-02+penny+arcade+%22internalize+this+deep+wisdom%22&hl=en&start=2&lr=lang_en">cached by Google here</a>).<br>

A few of us were getting owned by some horde in Stranglethorn. &nbsp;I must have been ganked at least 8 times. &nbsp;One of the times, Deatheris and I had a horde lvl 52 Undead Rogue at about 20% of his health, but he had backup come in and deal with us. &nbsp;Finally the tables were turned and we flushed the cowards out. &nbsp;Read the chat log on the left (in blue). &nbsp;Candlejack was one of the a-holes (in a group of about 5) that was ganking us. &nbsp;Yeah, he was only lvl 39, but he had at least 2 horde buddies that were over lvl 50 with him.<br>

<br>
Later on, Airhawk Alliance answered the call to protect Dark Shire from the Horde. &nbsp;After the invading cowards had all died and/or fled, we took a photo-op to commemorate the victory. &nbsp;Quite the cavalry we have.<br>

Here I am at lvl 39. &nbsp;I made 3 lvl's over the weekend (Feb 11-13 2005). &nbsp;My chance to crit is now over 11%! &nbsp;I am about 23% of the way to lvl 40 at this time (2004-02-14). &nbsp;It's almost horsy-time!<br>

<br>
LEVEL 40 BABY!!! &nbsp;At about 06:00 today (Feb 11-15 2005) I made lvl 40. &nbsp;I got my noble steed (which I've named "Donkey"), trained up on my spells, and rode around for a few minutes to bask in the glow of 60% faster movement. &nbsp;Then the server went down. &nbsp;For once, I didn't care because I had my steed and needed sleep as bad as I have in quite a long time (maybe a day or two, damn game).<br>

<br>
Now at lvl 42. &nbsp;Handsome as ever.<br>

Null is catching a ride to Thunder Bluff.<br>

This is BigGuySneaks, my new rogue. &nbsp;I realized that Bashade was an odd name, and it was tough for people to know that he was an alt for BigGuyKills. &nbsp;I got him to lvl 17 in under 22 hours by doing a non-stop marathon from Sunday night to Tuesday morning (with a few hours of server outages).<br>
<img style="width: 1024px; height: 768px;" alt="BigGuySneaks" title="Level 17 in under 22 hours." src="WoWScrnShot_022205_004146.jpg"><br>
<br>
BigGuySneaks is rather stealthy. &nbsp;Here I am hiding in a cave, waiting for my time to strike. &nbsp;Those bones on the ground in front of me are from my first failed attempt to survive in this cave. &nbsp;I am in the dead center of this screenshot, you can just faintly see me if the light is low in the room that you view this page from.<br>
<img style="width: 1024px; height: 768px;" alt="BigGuySneaks in the dark" title="Can you see me?" src="WoWScrnShot_022105_164148.jpg"><br>
<br>
Burny dies. &nbsp;That phrase sounds pleasant to me. &nbsp;Burny was a lvl 52 Priest that thought he would pillage me immediately after I finished killing a Rabid Blisterpaw (seen in the foreground). &nbsp;I can imagine what he must have thought: "Look at that f-ing lvl 47 Paladin. Those arrogant bastards. I'll show him who's the king of these sands."<br>
That's when he attacked me. &nbsp;About 2 minutes later I had spent all my protection spells, but there was a dead (or is it undead, re-dead maybe?) Priest on the ground.<br>
You can see that "Lay On Hands" hasn't recovered enough to even show a sliver of cooldown time. &nbsp;Divine Shield seems to have cooled down about 1-2 minutes worth (of a 5 minute cooldown). &nbsp;Because of this, I knew full well that if he returned that he could probably take me. &nbsp;I'm tough, but I'm not stupid, so I mounted up and headed back to Gadget to turn in some quests.<br>
You might notice my shout-out in guild chat<br>

<br>
I made lvl 50 on March 19th 2005. &nbsp;I would like to take this time to thank <a href="http://www.thottbot.com/?i=15860">[Ragehammer]</a> for getting me to this milestone. &nbsp;At lvl 51 I picked up a <a href="http://www.thottbot.com/?i=7522">Backbreaker Of The Monkey</a>.<br>

I thought I'd show you what a high end instance battle looks like. &nbsp;This is Hazzas. &nbsp;He and Morphaz can be found in the Sunken Temple at the "Swamps of Sorrow".<br>

<br>
Ithalia has about the coolest looking armor in the game. &nbsp;I wish my gear matched that well.<br>

Meet BigGuyHeals, my new Priest. &nbsp;I started him on 26 March 2005, mostly because I liked the name so well. &nbsp;He is surprisingly fun to play though.
