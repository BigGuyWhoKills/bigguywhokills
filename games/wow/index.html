	I've divided this WoW page into multiple pages, based on the servers that I play on. &nbsp;I didn't think it fair that images from my old server, FrostWolf, were pushing the more recent images to the bottom of the page. &nbsp;The old style also made for a page that took forever to load on a slow connection (in ye olde modem days). &nbsp;So I am borrowing from my <a href="../swg/index.html">Star Wars Galaxies page</a>, and the results can be seen below.

	<b>Update 2005-02-10</b> - Ok, I caved in and decided to reduce the size of my screenshots to 1024x768. &nbsp;At 1600x1200 they side-scroll even on my PC at home (where most of the images were taken).<br>
	<b>Update 2005-08-01</b> - PvPOnline and Penny-Arcade have thrown down the virtual gauntlet and formed guilds on the new Dark Iron server. &nbsp;PvPOnline started a guild named <a href="http://www.panda-attack.com/">Panda Attack</a>, based on a <a href="http://www.pvponline.com/archive.php3?archive=20030413">recurring joke</a> in the comic. &nbsp;Penny Arcade came out with two guilds, Knights Of Arcadia and an overflow guild named <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/view.php?date=2005-01-10&amp;res=l">Fancy Lads</a>, which has shown up a <a href="http://www.penny-arcade.com/view.php?date=2005-07-22&amp;res=l">few times</a> in their strip.<br>
	<b>Update 2005-08-02</b> - Hooray! &nbsp;I was able to make it into <a href="http://www.panda-attack.com/">Panda Attack</a> today! &nbsp;<a href="WoWScrnShot_080205_221339.jpg">Here is a SS</a> taken shortly after getting in. &nbsp;They have already done 2 purges, to get rid of players that were too low level and not serious about playing. &nbsp;I agree with this course of action because we don't want a guild full of chat whores. &nbsp;Go find an IRC channel if you want to enjoy the community.<br>
	<b>Update 2005-08-03</b> - Scott <a href="http://www.pvponline.com/archive.php3?archive=20050803">put up a strip today</a> showing the result of last nights raid (our first raid). &nbsp;We tend to out-level the Alliance, but they completely outnumber us.<br>

<p class="cnormalplus2">Stories</p>
<p class="normal">
<b>My first solo PvP success</b> - I've had a few good days lately. &nbsp;This last weekend (2005-02-05) I also had my first PvP success all by myself (I had many PvP kills prior to this that I had gotten when part of a group).<br>
I was walking back from the Ruins of Alterac (that I had no right being in because I was about 7 levels too low for it) when I saw a lvl 37 (I was lvl 32 at that time) Undead Warrior about to finish off an Ogre. &nbsp;Since her health was about 80%, and I was certain that she had seen me already, I decided to take her head on.<br>
As I ran towards her I turned on "Seal of the Crusader" and used "Judgment" to inflict her with that seal. &nbsp;Both my "Devotion Aura" and my "Blessing of Might" were already enabled on me. &nbsp;Once Seal of the Crusader was judged on her, I used "Seal of Command" to enable massive amounts of "Holy damage" against her.<br>
She ran circles around me in order to try to attack me from behind and keep me from hitting her, but it wasn't enough, and I was able to keep her in front of me almost the entire time. &nbsp;Her attacks were powerful, and it took less than 20 seconds for her to get my health down to 30%. &nbsp;So I healed up and kept fighting. &nbsp;With her health at about 65% I realized that I would need to heal a few times in order to defeat her. &nbsp;With my Paladin healing and 6.9% chance of getting a critical hit, I was able to kill her and still had about 20% of my mana left (about 2 more heals if I needed them).<br>
<br>
So I keep walking back to Southshore, stopping from time to time for beast kills, when who did I see at the top of a nearby hill? &nbsp;That's right, our favorite undead warrior. &nbsp;This time she was at full health and seemed to be pissed off.<br>
So she charged down the hill at me, while I refreshed my Blessing of Might and turned on Seal of the Crusader again (My Devotion Aura was still on). &nbsp;As she got within range I judged Seal of the Crusader on her and used Seal of Command again. &nbsp;Again she ran circled around me again, but I was able to keep her in front of me the entire time.<br>
Once my health was below 40% I decided to heal myself. &nbsp;So I used "Hammer of Justice" to stun her for 4 seconds while I tended my wounds. &nbsp;That restored me to about 70% health, and she was no longer stunned, so we started back at it. &nbsp;She hadn't figured out by this time that the running in circles wasn't gonna work, and she began doing that again. &nbsp;I knew it was just a matter of time before I win, and after a few more seconds I healed up again. &nbsp;After the second heal, she must have figured out that it wasn't going well for her, and when she gets to about 20% health, she tries to run away.<br>
But by this time my Hammer of Justice had recharged and I stunned her for another 4 seconds and continued to pound her mercilessly. &nbsp;She recovered from that stun with about 7% health and continued to run in a panic. &nbsp;I knew that it was a panic because she ran right into and past a tiger, and then she had two enemies to deal with. &nbsp;She didn't last long then, and as a bonus to me, we had run past the tiger's hunting area, so when we killed her, the tiger didn't even attack me, but ran back to where he was before.<br>
Now I had beaten a lvl 37 Warrior (five lvls above me) twice in about 20 minutes, so of course I broke out in dance and took a screenshot.<br>
I will grant that each time I had a bit of help. &nbsp;The first time she was at only 80% health from fighting that Ogre, and the second time the tiger added insult to injury, but I would take her on any day of the week.<br>
<br>
2014 insight: It took me a very long time to kill that Warrior. &nbsp;Paladin DPS was pathetic in 2005. &nbsp;But the fact that I killed a Warrior, 5 levels my senior, two times, is a credit to the resilience of the Paladin class. &nbsp;I also now realize she night not have been trying to get behind me to avoid my swings, but possibly to get a better hit table. &nbsp;I didn't know about hit tables back then. &nbsp;Also note that Paladin abilities are nothing like this anymore.
