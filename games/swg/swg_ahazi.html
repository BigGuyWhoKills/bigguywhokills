<b>BigGuyWho Kills</b> is a member of "<a href="http://www.guildportal.com/Guild.aspx?GuildID=13350&TabID=111456">Scum & Villany</a>", and we are dedicated to eliminating the Imperial presence on Lok and eventually the entire galaxy. &nbsp;I love this guild because it has the feel of a close family or a small group of friends. &nbsp;There are times that I will completely stop playing for an hour or so, just because we are having so much fun in guild chat.<br>

I took this picture after making Master Image Designer (2004-12-15).<br>

This is BigGuy as of 2004-12-17. &nbsp;I thought that since I am now a Master Image Designer, I ought to wear something other than dork clothes and cheap armor. &nbsp;This set gives me +51 to healing wounds and injuries.<br>

I use this screenshot as an example of the detail level that I play with. &nbsp;This is 1600x1200 with all setting maxed out. &nbsp;As you can see, I am still getting 30 FPS, though it drops into the 20's when I'm riding a vehicle across the ground.<br>
