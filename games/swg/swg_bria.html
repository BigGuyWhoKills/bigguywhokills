<h1>Ieseca Eadhaun on Bria</h1>
<div style="text-align: left;"><br>
<br>
<b>Ieseca</b> is a member of <a href="http://www.truefellowship.net/">True Fellowship</a> (or <a href="http://www.guildportal.com/Guild.aspx?GuildID=7613&TabID=61550">here</a>). &nbsp;True Fellowship is probably the largest PA in Bria. &nbsp;The best part of being in a PA this large is that you can always find someone that can answer your question, or who has something you need, or who is willing to jump in and help you on a tough mission. &nbsp;My plan for Ieseca is to progress far enough to open my "Force Sensitive" slot.&nbsp; Then I will focus almost entirely on my new FS character.<br>
<br>
<b>UPDATE!!! -</b> 2004-12-06: I finally got my "glow" today!!! &nbsp;Thank you, thank you. &nbsp;You are all too kind. &nbsp;I know what you are all thinking: "He's had the game for 17 months and just barely opened up his FS slot?" &nbsp;Well..... shut up!<br>
<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;">
This was my first attempt at armor.&nbsp; <br>
I started Ieseca with a carbine, and loved the benefit of range without the penalty that a rifle suffers at point blank.<br>
But all this tough talk just meant that I could solo a Durni.<br>
<img style="width: 315px; height: 600px;" alt="My first armor" title="Ieseca Eadhaun" src="screenShot0007.jpg"><br>
<br>
I eventually found out that bone armor had no protection from energy damage, so I bought some Chitin armor (mostly).<br>
I was going for a neo-Scottish kilt look.&nbsp; Well, actually I didn't yet know about stat migration, and wasn't able to wear the Chitin leggings that I had purchased.<br>
<img style="width: 338px; height: 888px;" alt="My second set of armor, a little bit more advanced" title="Ieseca Eadhaun" src="screenShot0664.jpg"><br>
<br>
Now that I had migrated some stats, I could finally wear a full suit of Chitin.<br>
<img style="width: 482px; height: 899px;" alt="My third set of armor, all chitin." title="Ieseca Eadhaun" src="screenShot1401.jpg"><br>
<br>
With some saved up money, I was able to buy some Composite armor, and handle a bit more damage.<br>
<img style="width: 458px; height: 914px;" alt="My fourth set of armor, some composite." title="Ieseca Eadhaun" src="screenShot1534.jpg"><br>
<br>
Now I've got almost a full set of Composite.<br>
<img style="width: 474px; height: 896px;" alt="My 5th set of armor.  Mostly composite." title="Ieseca Eadhaun" src="screenShot1549.jpg"><br>
<br>
The mix of 3 different colors of Composite is a sure indication that I was poor.<br>
Jaron of True Fellowship was kind enough to donate the purple armor to me.<br>
<img alt="My 6th set of armor.  Mostly composite, but now with a helm." title="Ieseca Eadhaun" src="screenShot1571.jpg"><br>
<br>
I went with a full set of Ubese armor for about a week.&nbsp; It was nice because I could wear it all without any buffs.<br>
<img
 alt="My 7th set of armor.  I switched to Ubese armor for a few days." title="Ieseca Eadhaun" src="screenShot1726.jpg"><br>
<br>
Here is most of a full set of Jaron's Advanced Composite.&nbsp; I still have to get a buff ,or meds to wear everything.&nbsp; But what you see here is without any stat modifications (no gloves or helmet).<br>
<img
 alt="My 8th set of armor.  A fine set of Advanced Composite made for me by Jaron." title="Ieseca Eadhaun" src="screenShot1751.jpg"><br>
<br>
Here I am in my full set of Advanced Composite.<br>
I need a total of 19 extra Constitution points and 30 extra Focus to wear this.&nbsp; That is easy to do with Muon and almost any food.<br>
<img style="width: 475px; height: 901px;" alt="Nice Armor!" title="My full set of Composite" src="screenShot1856.jpg"><br>
<br>
I hit this Stormtrooper HARD!&nbsp; I used /overchargeshot2 on him while my rock beetle tanked for me.<br>
This was my first near-solo of a Stormtrooper.<br>
<img style="width: 1280px; height: 1024px;" alt="I hit this punk hard." title="Dead ST" src="screenShot1399.jpg"><br>
<br>
Proud, after assisting in an ATST kill.<br>
I really didn't help much, but I'll grab a screenshot of it none the less.<br>
<img style="width: 1280px; height: 1024px;" alt="A picture of an ATST that I helped kill." title="Dead ATST" src="screenShot1522.jpg"><br>
<br>
I am a Rebel!<br>
I was so proud of making it to novice Commando that I took a killer pic of the moment.<br>
<img style="width: 1280px; height: 1024px;" alt="A picture of me in front of the banner of the Rebellion." title="Rebel Pride!" src="screenShot1400.jpg"><br>
<br>
Nasren decided to see how he compared to /flamesingle1. He lost.<br>
Canyon City was being hit hard by player Imperials, and I answered the call to assist my Rebel comrades.<br>
<img alt="Nasren takes a dirt nap." title="Nasren takes a dirt nap" src="screenShot1764.jpg"><br>
<br>
I can solo a Rogue Fambaa without any difficulty.<br>
This shot looks like it hurt me quite a bit, but I was alright.<br>
And as fast as the action was going, you can still see Kroole swearing in GuildChat.<br>

<br>
<b>Jump To Lightspeed is out!</b> &nbsp;I love this friggin game again!<br>
Here is probably my favorite picture that I've captured so far in JTL. &nbsp;This is my X-Wing, taken about 2004-11-04 on my backup PC (which I use to play on when at work, my gaming PC runs SWG at 1600x1200).<br>
<img style="width: 1024px; height: 768px;" alt="My X-Wing" title="Pimpin' X-Wing" src="screenShot0034.jpg"><br>
<br>
In some sectors there are massive electrical storms. &nbsp;They don't damage your ship, but do make for some great screen shots.<br>
<img style="width: 1024px; height: 768px;" alt="My X-Wing" title="Braving the storm" src="screenShot0037.jpg"><br>
<br>
I still can hold my own on the ground. &nbsp;Graul Maulers tend to spawn near the abandoned Rebel base on Dantoine, but I can BBQ them without a buff and wearing only half my armor.<br>
<img style="width: 1024px; height: 768px;" alt="A big Graul Mauler" title="If you want to play catch, I'll come back later!" src="screenShot0026.jpg"><br>
<br>
The Gurreck and I get along nicely. &nbsp;Yeah I staged it, but you've got to admit it's hilarious.<br>
<img style="width: 1024px; height: 768px;" alt="Um, it's nice to meet you too." title="If you want to play catch, I'll come back later!" src="screenShot0029.jpg"><br>
<br>
This is a better example of what /flamesingle2 can do: over 12k of damage!<br>
<img style="width: 1280px; height: 1024px;" alt="Crispy ST" title="Kneel before your master!" src="screenShot1962.jpg"><br>
<br>
This is what I look like are of December 2004.<br>
<img style="width: 450px; height: 1038px;" alt="Ieseca" title="Ieseca" src="screenShot0229.jpg"><br>
<br>
Here is the assault on the Kessell Corvette that I took part in for my master Rebel Pilot badge. &nbsp;In this shot we are still working on the guns.<br>
<img style="width: 1600px; height: 1200px;" alt="Assault on the Kessell Corvette" title="Working on gun #4" src="screenShot0175.jpg"><br>
<br>
After it was disabled, we waited on the party members that had been killed to repair and return. &nbsp;In this shot you can see my X-Wing clearly.<br>
<img style="width: 1600px; height: 1200px;" alt="Assault on the Kessell Corvette" title="Waiting on the dead to return" src="screenShot0177.jpg"><br>
<br>
Some NPC X-Wings started attacking the Corvette, so several of us took up a position over the bridge to keep the ship from blowing.<br>
<img style="width: 1600px; height: 1200px;" alt="Assault on the Kessell Corvette" title="Now we are protecting it" src="screenShot0180.jpg"><br>
<br>
And here is the big guy after all was said and done. &nbsp;About 8 people got their master badge this trip. &nbsp;I got 43,000 Pilot XP for helping kill it, but of course I don't need XP at this point anymore.<br>
<img style="width: 1600px; height: 1200px;" alt="Assault on the Kessell Corvette" title="BURN BABY, BURN!" src="screenShot0182.jpg"><br>
