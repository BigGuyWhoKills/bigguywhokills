<h2><font face="EXOCET">Not a whole lot of time put into this page (yet), so hold on for a while, and hit 'reload' often.</font></h2>

<h3><font face="EXOCET">First some files.</font></h3>
<p>
	<font face="EXOCET">Diablo First Aid, a decent multiplayer backup. Note: This is my favorite backup program, but these other two are very good too (That's why I use all three).</font>
</p>
<p>
	<font face="EXOCET">Another couple of good backup programs are: Diablo Backup and Diablo Multiplayer Backup. (<b>Note:</b> these are all MULTIPLAYER backup programs. They will NOT backup offline characters). Diablo Backup has great documentation, and lots of features. Diablo Multiplayer Backup creates only one file, but accepts command line parameters. (I use it to automatically backup my players by putting it in my 'startup' folder on my start menu in Windows.)</font>
</p>
<p>
	<font face="EXOCET">I am sick of listening to people ask where the multiplayer files are stored. They are in your windows directory, and are named dlinfo#.drv (where # is a number from 0-9). Diablo also makes some entries in your system registry, so use a program, don't do it yourself unless you know what you're doing!</font>
</p>
<p>
	<font face="EXOCET">If you are interested, here is the <a href="diablofont.zip">font used in Diablo</a> (38k). If you have this font installed on your system, then this page will look VERY different. Allot of other pages have this font, but I added a readme file with instructions and the font name, as seen from documents, Exocet.</font>
</p>
	<h3><font face="EXOCET">Now, the rest.</font></h3>
<p>
	<font face="EXOCET">Check to see if I'm on <a href="http://www.battle.net/">Battle.Net</a>. I use the name 'AdamRules' (my warrior), Drag_Queen (my rouge), and AdamSux (my mage). As you can probably tell, I don't really care much for the magi (My rouge would show him who the weaker sex <b>REALLY</b> is). If I make a game it is usually called 'fascist'. (I sometimes password protect the game, so whisper me in open tech support or e-mail me if you want into a later game) I'm also not much of a trader. I will usually swap stuff that we've picked up in that game, but not much else.</font>
</p>
<p>
	<font face="EXOCET">Well, I'm gonna hop online and play now, see ya later.</font>
</p>
<p>
	<font face="EXOCET">By the way, hex-editing sucks! Leave SoftIce alone! Check out and join the movement!</font>
</p>

</p>
<p>
	<font face="EXOCET">And so do 'pk' and 'tk' players. There is nothing wrong with a player vs. player battle when everyone is aware that it's gonna be a fight, but chopping into the back of someone who thinks you are an ally is more than just kinda weak.</font>
