This page is about <a href="http://www.farcrygame.com/">Far Cry</a>.&nbsp; Mostly it is a collection of links and info, mixed in with some screen shots, because I love taking screen shots.&nbsp; The first screen shots were taken with my GeForce TI 4200, and the later ones are with my GeForce 6800 GT.<br>
