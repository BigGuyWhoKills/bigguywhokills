This was pieced together by <a href="http://www.twiztedgaming.com/forum/announcement.php?f=64&announcementid=5">Hugh &amp; Tom</a> from guess-work/game experience/other forum posts, to come up with some of the requirements for the basic medals, awards and ribbons. &nbsp;We in the community owe them thanks for the great work that they have done on this.<br>
<br>
You can find a more updated guide <a href="http://www.geocities.com/whiplash450/index.html">here</a>. &nbsp;However, that page is often down.<br>
<br>
On that site is a much more detailed guide, however a lot of the ribbons are kinda vague because few people can remember how they got them. &nbsp;This was written from experience and everyone seems to have it slightly different, ESPECIALLY the ribbons. So, sorry if the guide does not help you out!<br>
<br>
For a full list of the Ranks see <a href="../ranks/index.html">my rank guide</a>.<br>
<br>
There is often more than one way to get the awards. &nbsp;One is <b>TIME</b> related, another is <b>KILL</b> related, or it may be a combination of the two.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>--Medals--</h3>
There are 18 unique medals, and each may be awarded multiple times.<br>
<br>
<br>

If any values are wrong, then they're wrong. &nbsp;Without an official release from EA, no-one is going to be certain of anything. &nbsp;As far as can be determined, promotions seem to be different for everyone, but the awards are given according to set criteria.<br>
