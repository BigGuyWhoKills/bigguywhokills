<h1>More about me...</h1>

&nbsp;
<h2><a name="General"></a>General Info</h2>
I was born on March 9th 1973 in Chelan Washington. I was raised in Manson Washington, and when I was 17, my family and I moved to <a href="http://local.yahoo.com/?location_state=UT&amp;location_city=Provo&amp;location_lat=40.233898&amp;location_lon=-111.657799">Provo, UT, USA</a>, where I started my senior year at Timpview High School. (That is where I met <a href="jaussi.html">Jon</a>)
<br>
I have been a member of <a href="http://www.lds.org/">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints</a> my whole life.
<br>
After high school, I enrolled at ITT Technical Institute in the Electrical Engineering Technology department. I did that for 2 semesters, and then went on a mission for my church. I spent 2 years in the Connecticut Hartford Mission, and served in 3 different states (CT, RI, and NY). I loved the experience, and if you want more information about my mission (or mission's in general), <a href="mailto:adamrules_2000@yahoo.com?subject=Mission">e-mail me</a>.
<br>
I got home in '94, and enrolled at <a href="http://www.uvsc.edu/">Utah Valley State College</a>. I was double majoring in Electronics and Computer Technology, and Computer Science, but I put that on hold because of the job.
<br>
Needless to say, I am a computer <a href="def.html#nerd">nerd</a> (NOT a computer <a href="def.html#geek">geek</a>), and proud of it. I have done this web page with <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla Composer</a> and <a href="http://www.jgsoft.com/">EditPad</a>.
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="Online"></a>Online Info</h2>
My e-mail address is: <a href="mailto:adamrules_2000@yahoo.com">e-mail me</a>.
<br>
I sometimes have ICQ installed and running. My <a href="http://www.icq.com/">ICQ</a> UIN is # <a href="http://www.icq.com/whitepages/wwp.php?uin=887428">887428</a> (follow this link to page me WITHOUT needing ICQ!).
<br>
I can be found online at home for a few hours a day, and at work during most of the work day. If you want to contact me by ICQ, AOL IM, Yahoo! IM, or MSN IM, just request my screen name via e-mail at: <a href="mailto:adamrules_2000@yahoo.com">e-mail me</a>.
<br>
I used to frequent a few <a href="http://www.kali.net/">Kali</a> servers like: XvT (server #709), Flight (server #417), and Warcraft (server #705), and use the nickname of 'AdamRules' (really, I do). I never use Kali anymore, because most games have adequate IP based multiplayer support. So, sadly, Kali is becoming a dinosaur.

<h2><a name="Computer"></a>Computer Systems</h2>
I have a new page devoted just to my various computer systems. &nbsp;You can check it out <a href="computer.html">here</a>.
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="Car"></a>Car Info</h2>

My favorite way to get around is in a 1967 Mustang GT 350 (Boss 302).
<br>
But since I don't have a 1967 Mustang, I drive whatever my neighbors leave unlocked.
<br>
I recently made a car specific page.  Please go <a href="car/index.html">here for my car page</a>.
<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="Work"></a>Work Info</h2>

I used to work for WCGS. &nbsp;I started on 17 October 2005.<br>
<br>
I used to work for <a href="http://www.nact.com/">NACT</a>. &nbsp;NACT produces class 4 tandem switching systems with capacities of up to 80 T1's in a single cabinet. &nbsp;I started on Aug 23, 1999 as a technical support engineer and ended on October 14th, 2005 as a Customer Service Engineer. &nbsp;My days at the office consisted of helping customers solve problems with their STX switching platform. &nbsp;Another part of my job is traveling to customers sites and installing new equipment for them. &nbsp;I've been to LA, NYC, Houston, Dallas, Orange County, Abidjan in Cote d'Iviore (The Ivory Coast), Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, and Istanbul and Ankara in Turkey for NACT.<br>

<p>My resume is out of date now, but <a href="resume.html">here</a> it is in HTML, and I can provide an OpenDocument, WordPerfect, or MS Word formatted versions upon request. </p>
