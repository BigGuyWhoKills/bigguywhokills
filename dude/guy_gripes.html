<h3>A few things all women should know:</h3>

-<a href="AG_issue21.jpg">Learn to work the toilet seat</a>. &nbsp;If it's up, put it down. &nbsp;We need it up, you need it down. &nbsp;You don't hear us bitching about you leaving it down.<br>
-If you won't dress like the Victoria's Secret girls, don't expect us to act like soap opera guys.<br>
-If you think you're fat, you probably are. &nbsp;Don't ask us. &nbsp;We refuse to answer.<br>
-Birthdays, Valentines' and Anniversaries are not quests to see if we can find the perfect present yet again!<br>
-If you ask a question you don't want an answer to, expect an answer you don't want to hear.<br>
-Sometimes, we're not thinking about you. &nbsp;Live with it. &nbsp;<a href="pvp19981010.gif">Don't ask us what we're thinking about unless you are prepared to discuss such topics as navel lint, shotgun patterns, or helicopters</a>.<br>
-Sunday = Sports. &nbsp;It's like the full moon or the changing of the tides. Let it be.<br>
-Shopping is not a sport, and no, we're never going to think of it that way.<br>
-When we have to go somewhere, absolutely anything you wear is fine.<br>
-Really. &nbsp;You have enough clothes.<br>
-You have too many shoes.<br>
-Crying is blackmail.<br>
-Ask for what you want. &nbsp;Let's be clear on this one: Subtle hints don't work. &nbsp;Strong hints don't work. &nbsp;Really obvious hints don't work. &nbsp;Just say it!<br>
-We don't know what day it is. &nbsp;We never will. &nbsp;Mark anniversaries on the calendar.<br>
-Peeing standing up is more difficult. &nbsp;We're bound to miss sometimes.<br>
-Most guys own three pairs of shoes. &nbsp;What makes you think we'd be any good at choosing which pair, out of thirty, would look good with your dress?<br>
-"Yes" and "No" are perfectly acceptable answers to almost every question.<br>
-Come to us with a problem only if you want help solving it. &nbsp;That's what we do. &nbsp;Sympathy is what your girlfriends are for.<br>
-A headache that lasts for 17 months is a problem. &nbsp;See a doctor.<br>
-Foreign films are best left to foreigners. &nbsp;(Unless it's Bruce Lee or some war flick where it doesn't really matter what they're saying anyway.) <br>
-Check your oil.<br>
-It is neither in your best interest nor ours to take the quiz together.<br>
-No, it doesn't matter which quiz.<br>
-Anything we said 6 months ago is inadmissible in an argument. &nbsp;All comments become null and void after 7 days.<br>
-If something we said can be interpreted two ways, and one of the ways makes you sad or angry, we meant the other one.<br>
-Let us ogle. &nbsp;We're going to look anyway; it's genetic.<br>
-You can either tell us to do something OR show us how to do something, but not both.<br>
-Whenever possible, please say whatever you have to say during commercials.<br>
-ALL men see in only 16 colors, like the old Windows 3.11 default settings. &nbsp;Peach, for example, is a fruit, not a color. &nbsp;Pear is also a fruit. &nbsp;We have no idea what mauve is. <br>
-If it itches, it will be scratched.<br>
-If we ask what's wrong and you say "nothing," we will act like nothing's wrong. &nbsp;We know you're lying, but it's just not worth the hassle.<br>
-What the hell is a doily?<br>
-Christopher Columbus did not need directions, and neither do we. <br>
-The relationship is never going to be like it was the first two months we were going out. &nbsp;Get over it, and quit whining to your girlfriends. <br>
-We are not mind readers and we never will be. &nbsp;Our lack of mind-reading ability is not proof of how little we care about you.<br>
-Thank you for reading this; Yes, I know, I have to sleep on the couch tonight.  But did you know we really don't mind that?  It's like camping.<br>
