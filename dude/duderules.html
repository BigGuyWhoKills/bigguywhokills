<h1><center>The Dude Rules</center></h1>
<h2>Part 1: Things dudes do, because they are dudes:</h2>
<ol>
<li>Dudes cruise in their cars, bikes, boats, etc. &nbsp;We are not sure exactly how this was done in days of old, but we are somewhat sure that horses were "hopped up" in some way.</li>
<li>Dudes spend money on cool things like sports equipment, tools, and weapons.</li>
<li>Dudes compete.</li>
<li>Dudes build things.</li>
<li>Dudes enforce and promote the Dude Rules.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Part 2: Things dudes don't do, because they are dudes.</h2>
<ol>
<li>Dudes don't touch other dudes, aside from handshakes and "high fives".</li>
	<ul>
		<li>In the event that one dude makes non intentional contact with another dude, he shall immediately state the unintentional nature of the contact with words such as "unintentional" or "accidental". &nbsp;Failing to do so will result in the affected dude striking the contact initiator.</li>
		Exceptions:<br>
		<ol>
			<li>When dudes fight, or are engaged in combat. &nbsp;Dudes may make contact with other dudes when the purpose of contact is to inflict harm.</li>
			<li>In life threatening situations, "unintentional" is understood, but must still be spoken soon after the situation ends.</li>
			<li>In manly events like ice hockey, football, rugby, etc. &nbsp;Contact sports, like combat, to not require announcing "unintentional".</li>
			<li>Doctors can make non-manly contact with another dude, and not need to state "unintentional". &nbsp;This only applies when treating ailments or for other health related reasons.</li>
		</ol>
		<li>Dudes may hug other dudes only if:</li>
			<ol>
				<li>Their favorite team wins a championship game.</li>
				<li>After a VERY long time has passed apart from a family member or close friend.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>If two dudes must hug, It must be short. &nbsp;The hug must contain three (no more, no less) pats on the back, exchanged by both dudes. &nbsp;The three pats replace the ancient dude tradition of saying the three words "I'm not gay" and/or "neither am I" when hugging.</li>
				</ul>
			</ol>
		<li>Because of the manly nature of sky diving, it is allowable to have another dude strapped to your back, but dudes must never admit to having done this.</li>
	</ul>
<li>Dudes do <b>NOT</b> sing along to pretty songs when only other dudes are around.</li>
<li>Dudes may never use words such as "cute", "sweety", "cup-cake", "dear", etc, when speaking to another dude. &nbsp;This applies even to fathers and sons.</li>
<li>Dudes do NOT look at each other <a href="222_01.png">when urinating in public restrooms</a>, or anyplace where dudes may be unclothed.</li>
<li>Dudes can never kick another guy in the jewels, unless he is under threat of death or worse (like prison rape, or when one of the above rules is intentionally broken).</li>
</ol>
<h2>Part 3: Things dudes don't do, because they are not women.</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Dudes don't do to other dudes what dudes do for women.</li>
		<li>Dudes don't compliment or judge the appearance of other dudes.</li>
		<li>Dudes don't hold open doors for other capable dudes, or walk through doors held open by other dudes.</li>
		<li>Dudes must never, NEVER, soften their handshake (fish hand) for a dude.</li>
		<li>Dudes do not cry.</li>
		-Exceptions:<br>
			<ul>
				<li>A loyal dog dies protecting his master.</li>
				<li>Opening a canister of really good chili.</li>
				<li>At another dudes wedding (traditional mourning when fellow dude loses 78.472% of his dudeship, applies to self).</li>
				<li>When the wind blows dust in his eyes, causing them to water, as he cruises in his manly convertible Mustang or motorcycle.</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Dudes do not decorate interiors. &nbsp;Walls should be one color, furniture does NOT need to match anything, and drapes are something that women use. &nbsp;The one exception is blackout curtains for your manly home theater room.</li>
	</ol>
