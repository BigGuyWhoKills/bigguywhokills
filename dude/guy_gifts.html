<h3>Ladies, here are some great gift ideas for the man in your life!</h3>
This was originally a set of rules written by a woman to help other women select gifts for men. &nbsp;A man later added the explanations.<br>
<br>
<hr>
Rule #1:<br>
When in doubt - buy him a cordless drill. &nbsp;It does not matter if he already has one. &nbsp;I have a friend who owns 17 and he has yet to complain. &nbsp;As a man, you can never have too many cordless drills. &nbsp;No one knows why.<br>
---<br>
Guy's Explanation to Rule #1: Cordless drill batteries wear out after a couple of years, and instead of buying 2 replacement batteries for $47 each, buy a new cordless drill kit with 2 batteries for $89! You get a new cordless drill plus two fresh batteries for less than the cost of two replacement batteries. &nbsp;To really excel, find out if the new battery types are compatible with the older style; you'll really score huge points for that one.<br>
<hr>
Rule #2:<br>
If you cannot afford a cordless drill, buy him anything with the word ratchet or socket in it. &nbsp;Men love saying those two words. &nbsp;"Hey George, can I borrow your ratchet?" "OK. &nbsp;By-the-way, are you through with my 3/8-inch socket yet?" Again, no one knows why.<br>
---<br>
Guy's Explanation to Rule #2: You can NEVER have too many tools; duplicates of every tool means a ready replacement for breakage or if you have to twist in alternating directions with both hands.<br>
<hr>
Rule #3:<br>
If you are really, really broke, buy him anything for his car. &nbsp;A 99-cent ice scraper, a small bottle of deicer or something to hang from his rear view mirror. &nbsp;Men love gifts for their cars. &nbsp;No one knows why.<br>
---<br>
Guy's Explanation to Rule #3: Cars can be construed (by guys) as mechanical works of art. &nbsp;Better to buy anything to clean or wax it with (e.g., special "auto detergent", a new type of carnuba wax, an orbital buffer, etc.). &nbsp;Don't buy dangly key chain thingies, or anything that might be considered a little "foo foo"; guys hate foo foo.<br>
<hr>
Rule #4:<br>
Do not buy men socks. &nbsp;Do not buy men ties. &nbsp;And never buy men bathrobes. &nbsp;I was told that if God had wanted men to wear bathrobes, He wouldn't have invented Jockey shorts.<br>
---<br>
Guy's Explanation to Rule #4: Right, correct, and absolutely. &nbsp;Men are not really interested in dressing up like a lady does. &nbsp;Instead, buy him sweats (a matching pair with the logo of his favorite sports team), or something in woodland camouflage.<br>
<hr>
Rule #5:<br>
You can buy men new remote controls to replace the ones they have worn out. &nbsp;If you have a lot of money buy your man a big-screen TV with the little picture in the corner. &nbsp;Watch him go wild as he flips, and flips, and flips.<br>
---<br>
Guy's Explanation to Rule #5: 'Nuff said...<br>
<hr>
Rule #6:<br>
Do not buy a man any of those fancy liqueurs. &nbsp;If you do, it will sit in a cupboard for 23 years.<br>
---<br>
Tom's Explanation of Rule #6: That's so true. &nbsp;At my house, everything like that, accrued over the past 20 years, has been relegated to a shelf in the garage.<br>
<hr>
Rule #7:<br>
Do not buy any man industrial-sized canisters of after-shave or deodorant. &nbsp;I'm told they do not stink - they are earthy.<br>
---<br>
Guy's Explanation to Rule #7: Not interested in smelling nice; get him a quart container of "Gunk Waterless Cleaner" instead.<br>
<hr>
Rule #8:<br>
Buy men label makers. &nbsp;Almost as good as cordless drills. &nbsp;Within a couple of weeks there will be labels absolutely everywhere. &nbsp;Socks. &nbsp;Shorts. &nbsp;Cups. &nbsp;Saucers. &nbsp;Door. &nbsp;Lock. &nbsp;Sink. &nbsp;You get the idea. &nbsp;No one knows why.<br>
---<br>
Guy's Explanation to Rule #8: Order IS beauty...everyone knows that. &nbsp;For the technological man in your household, get him one of the electronic label makers that can change the font, the size, the color ribbon, etc., and it prints instead of impacts the letters.<br>
<hr>
Rule #9:<br>
Never buy a man anything that says "some assembly required" on the box. &nbsp;It will ruin his Special Day and he will always have parts left over.<br>
---<br>
Tom's Explanation to Rule #9: I don't know about that. &nbsp;Part of being a man is the challenge of creating something "from scratch". &nbsp;Who really needs directions, anyway? Men have an inborn ability to KNOW how things go together. &nbsp;So there are a few parts left over. &nbsp;I never let a little thing like that stop me!<br>
<hr>
Rule #10:<br>
Good places to shop for men include Northwest Iron Works, Parr Lumber, Home Depot, John Deere, Valley RV Center, and Les Schwab Tire. (NAPA Auto Parts and Sears' Clearance Centers are also excellent men's stores. &nbsp;It doesn't matter if he doesn't know what it is. &nbsp;"From NAPA Auto, eh? Must be something I need. &nbsp;Hey! Isn't this a starter for a '68 Ford Fairlane? Wow! Thanks.")<br>
---<br>
Guy's Explanation to Rule #10: A '68 Fairlane may be a little limited; something infinitely better is a barely used 4 barrel Holley carb off a 302. &nbsp;It may even be adaptable to a lawn tractor.<br>
<hr>
Rule #11:<br>
Men enjoy danger. &nbsp;That's why they never cook - but they will barbecue. &nbsp;Get him a monster barbecue with a 100-pound propane tank. &nbsp;Tell him the gas line leaks. &nbsp;"Oh the thrill! The challenge! Who wants a hamburger?"<br>
--- <br>
Guy's Explanation to Rule #11: Plus a knit cap, Gore-Tex cooking gloves, Teflon coated metal or titanium cooking utensils, a 15 lb. chemical fire extinguisher that'll fit a NASCAR roll cage mounting bracket, etc.<br>
<hr>
Rule #12: <br>
Tickets to a Hockey/Football/Basketball/Baseball game are a smart gift. &nbsp;However, he will not appreciate tickets to "A Retrospective of 19th Century Quilts." Everyone knows why.<br>
---<br>
Guy's Explanation to Rule #12: "Quilts? Ummm, I need to change the oil in the truck and give it a tune-up, but you go ahead without me..."<br>
<hr>
Rule #13:<br>
Men love chainsaws. &nbsp;Never, ever, buy a man you love a chainsaw. &nbsp;If you don't know why - please refer to Rule #8 and what happens when he gets a label maker.<br>
---<br>
Guy's Explanation to Rule #13: Chainsaws are a "coming of age" tool for a man, much like a first pickup truck or a 30-06 rifle. &nbsp;A corollary: If you chose to get him a chainsaw, get him the biggest or next to the biggest chainsaw you can find; preferably the type used up in the Yukon or Canadian territories. &nbsp;Get the bright orange & white Stihl 24-incher or the bright red Husqvarna with a massive wood hook to jam into the log while cutting. &nbsp;Never mind that he'll only ever use it to cut up the firewood he already bought in small chunks; it'll actually become a conversation piece among his friends, and soon every other wife will have you to thank for buying him his chainsaw pride & joy.<br>
<hr>
Rule #14:<br>
It's hard to beat a really good wheelbarrow or an aluminum extension ladder. &nbsp;Never buy a real man a step ladder. &nbsp;It must be an extension ladder. &nbsp;No one knows why.<br>
---<br>
Guy's Explanation to Rule #14: Step ladders are for changing light bulbs. &nbsp;Real work requires the ability to extend to the peak of your roof from the side of the house, even if you could use a 12 footer to get over the low side. &nbsp;You never know when you'll have to install a new satellite system. &nbsp;A minimum of 24', Class IA extension ladder in either aluminum or fiberglass.<br>
<hr>
Rule #15:<br>
Rope. &nbsp;Men love rope. &nbsp;It takes us back to our cowboy origins, or at least The Boy Scouts. &nbsp;Nothing says love like a hundred feet of 3/8" manila rope. &nbsp;No one knows why.<br>
---<br>
Guy's Explanation to Rule #15: Rope is a universal tool. &nbsp;You can pull a disabled car to the garage, remove an engine block, tie down a load of lumber, or lift a heavy item straight to the second floor without going through the house. &nbsp;Best purchase would be 100+ feet of 10mm climbing rope that can be used for rappelling on weekends or building a rope bridge.<br>
