Although this is a picture of a Heckler &amp; Koch compact .40 caliber,
I want a compact .45 caliber. (I already have a full size .45, no need
to complicate ammunition issues.) Note how the magazine has a pinky finger
lip for a more comfortable grip. Some pictures may not show this, but the
gun comes with one extended and one not (the magazine floorplate is interchangeable).

This bad boy is a Heckler &amp; Koch USP Tactical. It's about the same
as a USP .45 but with a few exceptions. First, the barrel is longer for
greater accuracy. Second, they added an O-ring to the barrel that locks
the barrel in place relative to the slide. This too is for accuracy. Third,
they added a match grade trigger. Fourth, they changed the standard sights
to tactical style sights (field serviceable and adjustable). Fifth, they
threaded the barrel for adding barrel mounted devices like suppressers.

This is a fine pistol, but the machine that I want is the newest to the
USP family - the Expert (below). The expert has all of the above features,
minus the threaded barrel, but with a longer slide and barrel. The down
side is that the Expert costs about $1,300.00 (the Tactical is a mere $850.00,
and my USP45 runs about $600.00). So I need to save up about $550.00, sell
my .45, and then I can get the BEST - the H&amp;K USP Expert.

You can read all about my limited experience with it on my <a href="index.html">gun
page</a>.
<center><img src="hk_mp5k_01.jpg" height="265" width="780"></center> This
is a Heckler &amp; Koch MP5k. Many people think that this is a PDW. And by
some definitions, it is. But in the world of Heckler &amp; Koch, the H&amp;K
PDW is a kit that includes an elaborate shoulder sling that allows the wearer
to conceal the weapon under a trenchcoat in a compact form, and with a quick
pull, the sling draws back the folding stock and allows the carrier to bring
the gun to shoulder quickly. It is meant to be used by secret service and
other VIP protection teams. Imagine the poor sap that tries something against
a properly trained team, and see's 4 of these appear out of nowhere. This
means you, Bin Laden, you pansy little sally. <p><a href="http://www.streetpro.com/usp/">Here</a> is a link to a pretty
good H&amp;K page.
