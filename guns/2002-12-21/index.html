Cliff, Marcus, Suzanne, Ina, Greg, and I went shooting this day in Springville
canyon. I brought my digital camera and we took some pictures.<br>
<br>
The drive up the canyon was treacherous. Even in 4 wheel drive we had some
slip issues. I rode in Marcus' Bronco, and took this (and a few more) pictures.<br>

Here is Cliff, Greg and Ina unloading the truck, and loading the weapons:<br>

Suzanne looks good holding a rifle.<br>

She did well, especially considering my AR15 is a heavy target version of the rifle.<br>

The AR15 was almost too much for Ina. She still shot it well.<br>

This is what 2-3 12 gauge rounds will do to a 3" tree branch.<br>

After a while, we decided to shoot some fully charged propane canisters.
We had 6 canisters of camp stove type, Coleman propane canisters (16.4 oz).<br>
We each had one to shoot at, and everyone hit theirs from about 30 yards.
Ina hit hers on her second shot. This shot was from Cliff's turn. <br>
I must have hit my canister off to one side or the other, because it shot almost straight up, spinning rapidly on it's axis.<br>

Here, Greg is helping Ina with the AR, while Cliff has my Ruger 10/22, and Suzanne and Marcus look on.<br>

Ina took a few pictures of us shooting clay pigeons. Here is Suzanne with
the Springfield bolt action .22LR, Cliff with my Winchester 1300 (12 gauge),
Greg with Marcus' Winchester 1200 (12 gauge), while I throw a clay.<br>

Before we left, we found 2 more 2 liter pop bottles in the truck, so we decided
to eliminate them with 12 gauge slugs. In this picture, I had just destroyed
a bottle of orange soda. The orange color in the air is vaporized orange
soda pop. Ina and I walked out later and had some orange snow cones.<br>

Ina and Suzanne thought that they could take on Cliff...<br>

...they failed. Here is a shot of them recovering.<br>

Then Suzanne thought she would try it alone...<br>

...In the end, it was Cliff - 2, the ladies - 0.<br>
