<H1>AK47 vs. AR-15 vs. Mosin Nagant</H1>

<p>Written by Head of the old Headsbunker.com, also known as "Ezra Coli" on the various message boards. &nbsp;Shamelessly stolen from <a href="http://7.62x54r.net/MosinID/MosinLinks.htm">7.62x54r.net</a></p>

    <td width="50%" style="width: 100%">Original author's comment:<br> "There's an ever present, unending debate over which is best, ARs or AKs, raging across the internet and in gun shops every day sending bile and bitter insults spewing both ways. &nbsp;This debate has turned fathers against sons, best friends against one another, and... well you get the point. &nbsp;The author is of the opinion that there are of course pros and cons to each family of rifle, and I refuse to engage in what is "best". &nbsp;As one who loves them all, especially the AK and AR series, I thought I'd pass on some of the knowledge I have gained over the years concerning these wildly different weapons. &nbsp;As a bonus, I'll toss in my knowledge of another favorite family of weapons at the Bunker, just because they are very popular these days and I often ramble about them. &nbsp;So, here, for the aid of those hammering one another in the debate, is some unbiased, non-slanted, untainted raw knowledge about the AK, the AR, and the Mosin Nagant."</td>
