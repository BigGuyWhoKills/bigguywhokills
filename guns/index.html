<p>This is my <a href="http://www.winchesterguns.com/">Winchester</a> <a href="http://www.winchesterguns.com/prodinfo/catalog/detail.asp?cat_id=512&type_id=104&cat=012C">1300 Defender</a>. It has an 18" barrel (the shortest legal barrel length), holds 8 rounds (7+1 of 2-3/4"), and can chamber both 2-3/4" and 3" 12 gauge shells including slugs and steel shot. I take good care of it by storing it properly and cleaning it after each use. I have a 9 round holding sling mounted to it, and I'm currently looking for a flashlight mount for a high output flashlight (but I'm about to give up and order a new slide with a built in light). I have considered buying a pistol grip for it, but the stock is just too useful for clay pigeons (can hardly miss at 20 yards). I think that I will instead get a pistol grip stock, so I get the control of a pistol grip, without losing a full length stock. I have two 25 round belt shell holders that I use when clay pigeon hunting, and all in all it's a fun setup.<br>

<p>I bought the above gun several years ago. &nbsp;It is a <a href="http://www.ruger-firearms.com/index.html">Ruger</a> K10/22T. &nbsp;Above is a picture of what it looks like (except that I have a Bushnell Sportview 3-9x40 silver matte finish scope mounted on it and a basic sling), and I plan on making some major modifications. &nbsp;The only modification that I've done so far is a magazine release extension. &nbsp;The other modifications that I am planning on are a stainless steel target barrel, a thumbhole laminate stock, a 2# trigger, and the slide release modification. &nbsp;My friend Kevin has the same basic version of this rifle (above), and it is a true winner with solid performance.<br>

<p>I also own a <a href="http://www.streetpro.com/usp/">Heckler and Koch</a> USP .45 (purchased 12 June 1998). &nbsp;This is an exceptional weapon that is as reliable as a autoloading handgun can get. &nbsp;It was a bit pricey, but so are most other guns of this caliber and quality.<br>
When I was in the market for a pistol, I know that I wanted a large caliber handgun. &nbsp;After some research, I added some more requirements: single/double action, frame mounted safety, .40/.45/10mm (9mm was never an option), and an external hammer. &nbsp;The external hammer was the one thing that set my mind on a HK or a Sig. &nbsp;That was the only thing that put Glock out of the running.
A few months earlier, HK had won the <a href="http://www.streetpro.com/usp/hksocom.html">SOCOM</a> competition for the new special forces primary handgun. &nbsp;The HK MK 23 beat out Sig, Glock, and Browning.<br>
Now I needed to decide on a caliber. The 10mm was new on the scene, and the FBI had many pistols and submachine guns fielded in this new round. &nbsp;But studies and field results were showing that this round had too much penetrating power, and would often carry on through the intended target, and cause unintended damage.<br>
Since my primary use of this weapon was for self defence, this was an unnaceptable risk. &nbsp;The .40 caliber round was fairly new, and was generating favorable reviews. &nbsp;But at the time it had not proved itself as well as the .45 caliber. &nbsp;That, and the fact that the .45 was the current king in stopping power, set my decision on the HK USP .45 (fullsize). &nbsp;Every stopping power comparison that I have seen since has put the .45 on top. &nbsp;I don't care about lab test either. &nbsp;The only test that I am willing to consider are real world shootings. &nbsp;These results are taken from police and coroner reports of personal defense, military, and other similar shootings.<br>
In the last report that I saw, CCI .45 Gold Dot's were the best round in terms of real world stopping power. &nbsp;That is the load that I currently use.<br>

<p>This is my <a href="http://www.bushmaster.com/">Bushmaster AR15</a>
<br>
<br>
</p></center>I have 8 magazines for it (6 steel, 1 Thermold, and 1 Orlite), a bipod, and a Nikon Buckmaster 3-9x40 scope.
<br>
Shooting this gun is more fun than I've ever had with a firearm. &nbsp;I've shot it at a range (boring) and on the side of a hill (very fun), and I can say that you haven't lived until you put a few dozen rounds into pop cans and milk cartons at 30+ yards.

Now to the guns that I want!</h2></center>

<center>Check <a href="hk.html">this</a> page to see the Heckler &amp;
Koch pistols that I want.
<p>This gun I really, really, want. Ryan and I went out shooting at RangeMasters
of Utah and rented this fun little toy.
<br><img src="hk_mp5k_01.jpg" height="265" width="780"></p></center>
This is a Heckler &amp; Koch MP5k 9mm. You wouldn't believe the fun it
is. There is hardly any kick or muzzle flip. One difference is that the
bad boy we rented had the 30 round magazine and the Navy trigger group,
which has the three round burst as well as single and full-auto mode. The
two of us went through 4 boxes of ammo (200 rounds). That took us about
40 minutes and cost me about $55, but I have three very cool sheets of
paper that once resembled something something like targets.

Now this is the next shotgun that I want to buy. This is the Remington
870 Express Super Magnum. I plan on doing some duck/phesant hunting later
this year, and this gun is what I plan on using. It's based on the legendary
870 model, but loads 3 1/2" shells. Very savory.
<center><img src="browning_04.jpg" height="92" width="500"></center>
This beauty is a <a href="http://www.browning.com/">Browning</a>
Gold Hunter 3 1/2" gas operated autoloading shotgun. The reason that I
would like this gun over others is that it can load all shotgun loads from
2 3/4" to 3 1/2" magnum. In fact, it's the first autoloading shotgun that
can load all 3 loads (and do so without adjustment). When I go duck hunting
this coming fall, this is the gun that I'd like to do it with. (Yeah right.
If you are reading this, then you probably know me well enough to know
that I wont be able to afford this kinda gun for quite a while. Oh well,
we can all wish.)
<center>
<p><img src="browning_03.jpg" height="80" width="500">
<br>The above shotgun is a Browning Special Sporting Over/Under 12 gauge.
One more gun that I will have to wait a long time to buy.
</p><p><img src="browning_02.jpg" height="119" width="250"> <img src="browning_01.jpg" height="123" width="250"></p></center>
These two guns are Browning Buck Mark 22 Bullseye sporting pistols. I'm a
big fan of Browning as you can probably tell, and I have fired several thousands
of rounds through a Browning pistol similar to the ones above. My father
owns an old Browning, and that is the gun that I have used so much. I did
a little research on the internet, and I think that my father's Browning
is in the Challenger series. I will continue researching this, trying to
find out what model it really is. Right now I have it disassembled for re-blueing.
When I get itback together, I will post a good picture of it.<p></p>
