<h1>
This is Adam's monopolies suck page!</h1>
Please listen to my babbling for just a moment. Use <a href="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape!</a>
Microsoft has a virtual monopoly on the computer software industry. There are few areas that this giant hasn't ventured. And where it ventures, it steps on the smaller (and often better) products, sending them to obscurity or death.
<p>Now you may say, "So what!" "If Microsoft can fill the need for a piece of software, let them." "Survival of the fittest." Or you may have your own words for the situation. <br>
Let me run this by you then. Bigger is not always better. Windows 95 has pushed <a href="http://www.ibm.com/">OS/2</a> to near inexistance. <br>
This lets Microsoft do whatever they want with the path that the home PC will take, and little or no options for us the end users. <br>
This lack of competition in the OS market <b>WILL</b> be a bad thing. <br>
Only the threat of competition keeps Microsoft on it's toes. We all need to thank the Linux community for their undying devotion to a better idea.<br>
Microsoft used to scoff at Linux. Recently they have taken steps towards legal action against the open source community, saying that open source is a danger to free enterprise.<br>
WHAT COWARDS! Who are they to try to restrict how others market their wares. That upsets me more than I can convey in this page.
</p><p>
</p><p>Please <a href="mailto:adamrules_2000@yahoo.com?SUBJECT=Gripe">e-mail</a> me with your response to this page. I love to hear well thought out responses to what I've said here, but I don't expect any of that from you brain-dead lemmings.
