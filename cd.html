I'm looking for singles to a few different bands. Singles usually have unreleased or non album tracks and sometimes re-mixes of album tracks and this is why I collect them. Here is a list of the bands that I collect singles from. Also if you ever find singles or any rare or special merchandise from these groups please contact me as soon as you can. Below each band name are the singles that I have and no longer need. Anything else is GREATLY appreciated.<br>

And if you have any questions remember, Adam LOVES Rush! My needs are:
1 - oxygen, 2 - Rush, 3 - water, 4 - food, etc...<br>

<b><font size="+1">If you want to make me REALLY happy, find one or all of these!!!!! </font></b>(and then give them to me)

<ul>
	<li>Rush - (These are the 4 most common singles)</li>
